**😞😞 WELCOME RILEY 😞😞**

This handsome hunk is Riley and he is approximately between 5 and 7 years old 🥰

Unfortunately, Riley is a sign of the times and a sad result of our rising cost of living. His Dad was made homeless with no where to go. Riley was on the streets and his Daddy knew he wouldn’t manage in the cold….absolutely heartbreaking and we just know this is a sign of things to come. It's something we are hugely worried about 😞

**Riley is a beautiful boy and gets on well with kids and other dogs based on a successful meet and greet.** He was neutered on arrival and all outstanding medical needs met, he was already in brilliant condition and it was obvious he was very much loved.

We want to reassure his family that he is doing really well. He is with a lovely foster family and being fussed over by 3 adoring kiddos and their lovely parents who were happy to hand feed him when he was a little sad this evening. Just so tragic but we have offered all we could and Riley is safe and warm ❤️

**Welcome to the family Riley ❤️**
