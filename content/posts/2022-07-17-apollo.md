‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è ADOPTION NEWS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Our wee Apollo has been adopted ü§ó

This wee Beagle cross is just a bundle of fun. He loved his mischief in foster, pinching ice cream and destroying toys, but also being a wee charmer. He is a loveable rogue and now hes found his perfect home üè°

Apollo, now called Ollie lives with his new brother and best mate Alfie. He walked in the door sat on the coffee table and made himself right at home üòÜ

His tail hasn‚Äôt stopped wagging since moving in with his new family. He loves to play with Alfie and to go for a wee splash in the river on their walks. We are just so happy he‚Äôs so happy ü•∞

You don‚Äôt need it, but best of luck wee man in your new forever home üíô
