> This little man is Apollo and he is a 2.5 year old beagle/daschund mix 🐶

Apollo has done so well in foster, quickly learning and settling into his new routine. It helps that he's a clever boy who loves his grub which helps with learning 🍪

Apollo loves humans and will follow you around the house, he is a sweet little man who becomes very popular with everyone he meets and we're sure it won't be any different with his new family 💙



Apollo is best suited to an active family as he's still a young man with plenty of energy. He can be a little over friendly at times, so any children would need to be dog savvy. Apollo would be fine as an only dog and although he is still learning his doggy manners in foster, he could live with another dog pending a successful meet and greet ✔️  



**Please get in touch if you can offer this lovely boy his forever home 🏡**
