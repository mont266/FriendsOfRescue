> *This gorgeous older spaniel boy is Tom and he is just a dream ❤️*

Tom arrived with us quite a while ago in awful condition. Dumped in the middle of nowhere, just skin and bones, with such matted, heavy hair. He was bruised, had lots of lumps and bumps and a mouth full of rotten teeth 😞

Fast forward a month or 2 and he is like a new man. The intention was to be adopted by his foster but it didn’t materialise so now he is on the hunt for his brand new beginning and whoever gets him will be so so lucky 🍀

Tom can live with other dogs, he would prefer a calmer household purely because of his age so we want a nice chilled home for him 🏡 

**Please get in touch to offer Tom his new start ❤️**
