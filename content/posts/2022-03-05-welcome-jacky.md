> *This little man is Jacky and he is 14 years young 🥰*

Jacky’s daddy passed away and when family took him in he was just so afraid of the resident dog and kids. He was living on edge and it wasn’t fair 💔


He has fretted a lot since his dad passed away and hasn’t eaten much so we really are going to work on getting him comfortable enough to eat and settle. He just wants love and company and that we can provide in abundance ❤️


We are currently looking for a foster home for wee Jacky. He can live as an only dog, or with other calm older dog(s) and no young kids ✔️ 


Please don’t overlook Jacky because of his age, he has loads of love to give ❤️


**Welcome Jacky ❤️**
