> *Our beautiful little deaf pupper Fawna has been adopted 🥰*

Fawna now has a vet mummy who loves her very much already. She will never want for a thing 🥰


She was a pleasure to have in foster, so keen to learn and eager to please. A wee dream ❤️


One thing Fawna didn’t avoid though was the dreaded ‘staffy arse’….she is gonna bring her mums house to the ground if she doesn’t stop 💨 😆


May god be with you all 😆
