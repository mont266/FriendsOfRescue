> This little cutie is Fawna and she is a 6 month old Staffy mix 

![](https://ucarecdn.com/aa86ab97-73cb-4b17-9ac9-57de68153abf/)

Fawna is only 6 months old and unfortunately this little angel is completely deaf. Fawna's owners didn’t feel they had the experience to deal with her disability so they sensibly brought her to rescue 🐶

She is such a wee sweetheart with people and other dogs too. Ideally we would want deaf experience for Fawna, and company so no long working hours. 

Fawna has been a dream in foster and learning hand signals and how to communicate a brand new way. Super smart girl 👩‍🏫

**Please get in touch to offer Fawna her new start**
