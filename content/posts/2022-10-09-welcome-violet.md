This little chihuahua is Violet and she is 5 years old 😍


Violet in pure chihuahua style has personality in abundance and is a little sass queen, and she absolutely adores the company of other dogs but obviously she is the boss 👸🏻

**Violet will be spayed this week and any outstanding medical work completed. She will then be available for adoption ✔️** 


Welcome to the family Violet ❤️
