> *This handsome wee man is Dudley üíô*

He's a 5 year old Yorkie who was brought in to a vets to be put to sleep due to his medication costs ü•∫

Thankfully the vets convinced the owners to surrender him instead. He has diabetes so he needs insulin shots twice a day but this gives him no bother at all, he's just a happy sweet wee dote ‚ù§Ô∏è

We'll have him up to our vets this week to have his bloods checked and give him the full MOT, until then he's happy being spoiled by his foster family  ü•∞
