🧡🧡 WELCOME DENNIS 🧡🧡

This handsome little fella is Dennis and he is bursting full of kitten energy 🧶

Dennis arrived with us several days ago crawling with fleas, he has since been treated and his vaccines started ✅️

Dennis loves his humans and follows them everywhere so be prepared to have a little shadow 🐈‍⬛️

Dennis can live with cat savvy children and other confident feline buddies. He can also live with cat friendly dogs 🏡
