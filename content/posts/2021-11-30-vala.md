Vala has obviously had a lot of mental trauma in her wee life because this wee dote was terrified. Given time and understanding her foster has said she is absolutely perfect in every way. Truth be told only her foster has her hands full with her own dogs already, otherwise she would be staying 🐶

When Vala arrived she was nursing a leg injury. Unfortunately it had already healed in a strange way but she is weight bearing and it’s causing her no pain. 

Vala would be best suited to a home with other dogs for confidence but it’s not essential aslong as she has company so someone who doesn’t work long hours. No cats and kids over 10+ ✔️ 

This gal deserves the world and more so we really hope her new start isn’t far away 🙏🏻
