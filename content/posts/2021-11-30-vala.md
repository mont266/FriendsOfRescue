> *Our little greyhound lady Vala has been adopted 🤗*

She had to wait a little longer to find her forever home, but when her new mum sent us a message we just knew it was meant to be. Her mum was aware that greyhounds make the most wonderful pets and that this lovely and gentle girl is no exception 🐶


Vala, now called Priya, lives with her sister Poppy, and with their similar sweet personalities, they instantly got on as the best of friends. The two of them now share a bed in their very own bedroom! 🛌

We’d like to say a thank you to Vala’s foster, who was the first to teach our girl kindness and love. We just know her new mum will shower her with it in abundance. It’s what rescue is all about and it was our pleasure to be a part of her journey 🥰


**Best of luck in your new forever home beautiful girl 💕**
