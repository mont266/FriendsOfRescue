Mabel is stubborn, rambunctious, and is as graceful as an elephant. She is also fiercely loyal, a fabulous companion, lovable, sensitive and really needs a family of her own ‚ù§Ô∏è

Unfortunately she has never been taught how to play properly. What she been given is toys to wreck, or shred, or kill so we have been working with a behaviourist to manage that and turn her rough play into more enrichment based play. And in pure sharpei style she is resisting every step of the way‚Ä¶..stubborn as a mule. Her crate training is going well, and for a dog that hated walking she is walking like a dream. We feel with the correct guidance from an experienced owner she will be 100% and a brilliant addition to her new home üè†

Mabel can live with kids 16+ and with another dog pending a successfully meet and greet, but would happily be an only pet ‚úîÔ∏è
