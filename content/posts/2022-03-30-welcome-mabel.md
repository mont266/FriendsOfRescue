Unfortunately Mabel has a very familiar story to us. She was advertised online FTGH, so someone took her in and it didn’t work with their resident dog. But thankfully for Mabel the cycle is broken for her and that family contacted rescue so she has since been spayed and is settling into foster 🐶

Mabel is a very friendly girl and has adjusted well to her new environment. We will know more about what kind of home would suit Mabel after her assessment period ✔️
