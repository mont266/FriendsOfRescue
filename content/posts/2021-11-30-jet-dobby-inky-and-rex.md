These little babies are a litter of 7 but our foster space is such an issue we literally squeezed in 4 and got another lovely rescue Sophie's Dog Rescue to take the other 3….meaning all 7 are safe 😮‍💨 

Welcome Jet, Dobby, Inky and Rex…all the boys 💙

These little lurcher/whippet mix babies are 9 weeks old. They have all been vet checked wormed/flead, vaccinated and microchipped today and thankfully all are happy and healthy ✔️ 

Like all of our pups they will all be rehomed with mandatory online puppy classes to ensure happy, well rounded/mannered puppies whilst they grow 🐶 

Ideally we would like doggy company for these little ones, no long working hours and definitely NO CHRISTMAS PRESENTS 🎁❌

Welcome to the family little skinny ones ❤️
