> Our little bonded pair of kitties have been adopted 🤗


Frieda and Diego came to us after being found at the side of the road. They had a bad dose of cat flu but a trip to the vets and some TLC from their foster for a few weeks and they were ready to find a home of their own 🏡


Frieda and Diego, now called Jinx and Pablo, are living their best life with their new parents. They groom away at each other and love nothing more then a wee cosy nook like their new igloo. Their new family is absolutely smitten and the feeling is definitely mutual 🥰



### **Good luck little ones in your new home ❤️**
