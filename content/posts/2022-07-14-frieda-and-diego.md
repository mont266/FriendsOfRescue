> These two darlings are Diego (ginger) and Frieda (black) and they are approx. 8 weeks old 😻

These poor babies were found at the side of the road with no sign of Mum 💔


They had a bad dose of cat flu which has since cleared, so now they are ready for their new forever home 🏡


These two are bonded and so will be rehomed as a pair ✌🏼


Frieda and Diego are still getting used to human interaction and so will need a cat experienced home that can help build their confidence ✔️


**Please get in touch if you can offer this gorgeous pair a home 🏡**
