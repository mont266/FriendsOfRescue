> Our little Westie ladie Trixie has been adopted 🥰


Trixie lost her Mum a few years ago, and since then, with changing circumstances she wasn’t quite able to settle down for her wee twilight years 🌟


Thankfully we have found her the perfect sofa to spend the rest of her days. She now lives with her new family that includes fur siblings Bonnie and Clyde 🐶


Having had an unsettled few years, understandably, she is still building up the trust with her new family. But we know she will get there, as overall she has settled in great and gets on the best with her new brother and sister. Which as just as well because she made her self right at home on what is clearly Clyde's chair 😆

### 
**All the best little Trixie, we are so happy for you in your new forever home 🏡**
