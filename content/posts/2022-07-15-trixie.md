Trixie lost her mum a few years ago and her family had been trying to make it work with her, but unfortunately due to a change in circumstances she was surrendered to us to find some stability for her twilight years 🌟 


Trixie is a sweet little lady, she is clean and tidy and loves human company. She walks well on the lead and really loves her home comforts 🏡


At 12 years young she knows what she likes and what she doesn't. She isn’t fussed on being lifted and just wants her space respected and peace and quiet, so we are seeking her a quiet home with no young children ✔️


Trixie can live with cats, and she has come out of her shell with the other dogs in her foster home so she could live with another settled and calm natured dog but could also quite happily live as the only pet and queen of the castle 👑


**Please get in touch if you can offer Trixie a spot on your sofa ❤️**
