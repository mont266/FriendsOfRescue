Baxter just completed his big surgery to be neutered (undescended testicle), Cherry eye removal and nostrils widened. The surgery was successful and he has really improved in terms of his breathing so we couldn’t ask for more ☺️

Baxter has been a dream in foster. He loves kids, dogs and people. He is an allrounder. We would like in his home to have playful doggy company but it's not essential. Baxter isn’t the type of dog that can climb mountains but he is a pup and does require exercise at his pace. Breed experience would also be preferred but again not essential ✔️
