Baxter came to us as a much loved pet but sadly his owners health was in decline and she came to us to be sure he found the right home. He settled great in foster and it wasnt long until we found his new forever home 🏡

Baxter now lives with his new family and bulldog sister Diva. To begin with she was sure to let him know who would be wearing the trousers. But this boy is a character and he soon worked his charm. They’re now the best of friends and if hes not too busy pinching dirty socks, you can find him and diva cuddled up and having a wee snog 😆

**All the best big man, delighted for you and your new forever ❤️**
