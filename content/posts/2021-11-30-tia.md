Guess who got discharged from the vets….TIA 🎈

For now, medically, we have done all we can. She is alive and improving. Her red blood cells are up to 37 now. So it's time for her to be in a home environment to get her built up and back on her feet before we can do anything more 🤞🏻

She arrived almost dead, she was 8kg and carried in on a stretcher. Leaving last night she was 13.5kg…she walked out 🙌🏻

She has a long way to go but my god we could all take something from this gal. Incredible ❤️

As you can imagine her best friend and favourite nurse Rosie, albeit delighted with her improvements, is really gonna miss her. We couldn’t resist getting some pictures of them together 🥰

Come one Tia, you have to get there. We are all rooting for you ❤️
