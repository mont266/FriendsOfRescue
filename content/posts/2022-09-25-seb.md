**🖤🖤 SEB’S APPEAL 🖤🖤**

This beautiful boy is Seb and he is a one year old lurcher mix 🥰

Seb was from a litter we rehomed last year but unfortunately due to a change in circumstances he is back with us.

Seb is lovely, pleasant, kind, hyper boy who enjoys the company of kids (8+ due to his size) and other dogs 🐶 

We very rarely get animals brought back to us and when we do it’s heartbreaking for not only them but us and our aim is always to be committed to the animals interests, so this time Seb it’s for keeps ❤️

**P﻿lease get in touch if you can offer this lovely boy his forever home!**
