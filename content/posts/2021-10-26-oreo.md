Oreo was already rehomed 6 weeks ago but in his new home he had a change in behaviour which wasn’t suitable for the family environment he was in. Dogs sometimes have ways of telling us that something isn’t right or somethings not working as it should so unfortunately we all felt in this instance it was the right thing to do to bring him back to us. And he has just been the amazing Oreo we always knew and loved ❤️


Oreo is an all round babe 😍


He absolutely loves playing with other dogs because he has lots of energy, so he needs a home where there is another playful doggy 🐶


Oreo doesn't like things being taken from him so could only live with older kids who understand dogs. He really enjoys the company of hoomans aswell as pooches ✔️


**Please get in touch if you can offer Oreo his forever home 🏠**
