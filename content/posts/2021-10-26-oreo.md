Oreo is an all round babe 😍

He absolutely loves playing with the dogs in his foster home because he has lots of energy, so he needs a home where there is another playful doggy 🐶

He could live with kids who understand doggy’s, and enjoys company of hoomans aswell as pooches ✔️

Please get in touch if you can offer Oreo his forever home 🏠
