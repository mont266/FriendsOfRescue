Oreo had such long wait in foster so we can’t express how happy we are that his perfect match came along. A bit like us his new mum couldnt believe there wasn’t more interest in him. But what is their loss is her and Oreo’s gain 😎

A thank you must go to Oreo’s foster who did such a great job and championed him from the minute he walked in their door. It’s because of that, that Oreo’s been settling so well in his new home. His mum has described him as a big dote and we just couldnt agree more ❤️


**Best of luck in your new forever home Oreo, you deserve every bit of it 🏡**
