Our beautiful Oreo has been adopted and he is just loving his new life, complete with a fellow furry sibling Max 🐾

Oreo was one cracker boy and we knew as soon as someone visited him they would fall in love and that’s exactly what happened ❤️

It couldn’t have worked out better for this beautiful boy 🐶

Best of luck boyo ❤️
