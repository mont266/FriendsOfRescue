> All of our little hand rear kitties have found their perfect homes 🏡


These poor wee cuties came to us at 3 weeks old after their mum sadly passed away in an accident 🥺


A massive thank you must go to their amazing foster mum, without her dedication the babies simply would not have survived. And not only was it this litter, but she actually hand reared another 4 kittens just before them. We honestly don't know what we would do without her 🙏🏼


First to find his new home was our little lad Cheeky. He is now called Mouse but he is certainly living up to his original name. His new mum said he spends his time sneaking up on new siblings Margo and Moody, rummaging through bins, and teaching himself how to climb up the cupboard handles. He is just running the house 😆


Second to find a home was Lala, the only girl of the litter. She now loves with her new family and new brother Louie. She didn't take long settling herself in, curling up on the sofa. Louie wasn’t overly impressed by her at first, but she has since worn him down for some snuggles on the sofa 🤗


And last but not least, we have Chacha and Boomboom who were rehomed as a pair. These boys have been renamed Q and Rambo as that's exactly what their wee characters are like! Their new Mum is just head over heals and knows all too well that she has two absolute sweethearts on her hands. They love a cuddle and have settled amazingly well 💙



### **Best of luck little ones, we are delighted for you all ❤️**
