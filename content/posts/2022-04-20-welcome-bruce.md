> *This beautiful fella is Bruce and he is a 17 month old cocker 😍*

Bruce arrived with us after constant bickering between him and another dog in the home.


Bruce has been amazing with us which his original family did tell us so we aren’t surprised. He's quite easy going for a cocker man and has plenty of manners. 
Bruce is fine with other dogs but he prefers to live as an only dog. Bruce is fine with kids (dog savvy) but does need company through the day so no long working hours 😊


Bruce has been neutered and all outstanding medical work completed and now ready for his new start ✔️
