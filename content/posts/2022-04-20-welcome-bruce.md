> *Bruce our super popular cocker man has been adopte*d 🥰

Cocker spaniels are one of the breeds where we have to clear our schedules for when their appeal goes up. They are so popular that there is never a shortage of home offers. But as always its about finding the right one for the dog in question, and it turns out that for Bruce, we didn’t have to look too far 🏡

Bruce, now called Buster, instantly thrived with his new family. They couldn’t say a bad thing about him and the feeling was mutual. He spent his evenings having sofa snuggles with his mum and we’re sure there will be plenty more of those to come 🤗

You won’t really need it, but best of luck in your new forever wee man ❤️
