Bruce was surrendered to us due to having arguments with the resident dog in the home. Both male, both unneutered due to veterinary advice and unfortunately neither dog were happy, so the family made the call to let Bruce go and we feel this was the right call.
Bruce has settled brilliantly into foster. He is great boy with a lovely temperament and handled his neutering procedure like a champ 😉


Bruce will be available for rehoming when his assessment period is over ✔️
