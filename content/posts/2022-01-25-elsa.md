> *This little hoppy lady is Elsa and she is 10 months old 🐰*

All her medical work is up to date and she is now looking for her forever home. She is a super friendly bunny, she is not a huge fan of being picked up but has a great even temperament and will let you pet her for hours. She is litter trained and wants to be an indoor bunny thats allowed to roam the house or have a good big pen. She loves her grub and has been giving her foster little bum twitches when they feed her green apples. Our kind of gal 😆


She is a little sensitive to noise so she would rather live without other pets or small children. ✔️


**Please get in touch if you can give Elsa her forever home 🏡**
