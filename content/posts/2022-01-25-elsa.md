> *Our little bunny Elsa has been adopted 🤗*

Elsa came into her own with us in foster as an indoor bunny, loving a good roam and nosy around the house. She has the loveliest temperament and loves her grub 🥕


Since moving in with her new mum nothing much as changed, from the get go she was very contented, taking her time exploring her new surroundings and getting more confident everyday ❤️


**All the best little hoppy lady, we’re sure you will love being spoilt in your new home 🏡**
