> *This wee man is a 2.5 year old cocker who was a much loved pet. Unfortunately, while he was a great boy most of the time, he began showing signs of cocker rage. We cannot be sure this is the problem so for now we have taken the information on board and start our own assessment ✔️*

Understandably the family with 2 young children, his family couldn't take the risk and  have thankfully chosen rescue. 
In foster (and our vets) he has been a lovely dog, friendly and sweet. He was already up to date on all medical work, neutered, vaccinated, chipped etc. So once his assessment period is complete, we'll update you all with his requirements (we already know he will be looking for a child free home)
