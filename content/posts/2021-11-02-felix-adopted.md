Felix (now called Milo) came to us 6 months ago with a broken jaw, mostly like from an RTA. He got his jaw wired and recovered with lots of TLC from his foster mummy 🥰

He showed her his sweet side and his mischievous side - always trying to sneak in for a splash in the bath 😆🛁

He got the wire out 3 months ago and had been on the search for his forever home but wasn't having much luck. Now we know why... he was already home🎈

His wee expression kills us 🥰

Welcome home from home Milo ❤️
