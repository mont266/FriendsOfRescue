> This wee dote is Winnie and she is just 4/5 months old

Winnie was found as a stray and unfortunately never reclaimed but thankfully she found her way to us 🙏🏻

Winnie is such a wee sweetheart. She adores her hooman foster brother and loves a bit of craic. Typical tortie….totally Princess but a little maniac at times too. She would benefit from a home with kids, and with a proper introduction she could live with other cats ✔️

**Please get in touch if can offer Winnie a home 🏡**
