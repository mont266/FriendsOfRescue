> *Our little cavalier mix babies are now looking for their new homes 🏡*

 
Charles and Sadie are very confident happy little puppies.  Charles adores playing with other dogs, and little Sadie is a very sassy, little princess who also loves a good carry on 🐶

Ideally each puppy would be rehomed to a home with canine company and no long working hours. The babies can be rehomed with kids 12+ ✔️ 


As always our puppies are rehomed with mandatory puppy classes which will ensure happy, well rounded dogs 🐶 


These babies are in foster in Derry/Londonderry area.
