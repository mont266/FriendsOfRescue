Our two little cavalier mix pups Sadie and Charles have been adopted 🤗


They came to us at just 7 weeks old after being dumped in a box outside someones house 😭


But fast forward and these two have each found their perfect forever homes 🏡


Sadie now lives with her new family and when she isnt getting cuddles she is learning how to dog from her furry brother and sister. She has fitted in like a glove 💗


Charles, now called Charlie, has fitted into his home just as well. His family said that's its like hes always been there, and although it took a day or two for his new fur brother to get used to the puppyness, they now have the best of fun playing together 🎾


All the best little ones, so happy you both found the home you deserve ❤️
