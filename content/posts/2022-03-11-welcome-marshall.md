> *Our gorgeous big breeze block Marshall has been adopted 🤗*

Marshall came to us from the pound, and all this man ever wanted was some love. He settled brilliantly in foster and now were so happy he has a home of his own 🏡

Marshall now lives with his new mum and dad and is already ruling the roost. He settled into his new routine and he is the perfect mix of being a snuggle bug and a man that just loves the craic and playing with his toys 🎾
