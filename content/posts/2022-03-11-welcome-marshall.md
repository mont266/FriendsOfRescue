> *This handsome breeze block is Marshall and he is an approx 2/3 year old staffie 🥰*

Marshall is seriously handsome, and he doesn’t even know it. He is super affectionate, loves a good snuggle and to balance it out he’s playful and kinda nuts too 😝


Marshall would be best as the only dog in the home. We haven’t had a beautiful Staffy in with us for a while so we are hoping that all those Staffy lovers out there are queuing up for this handsome boy😍



**Please get in touch to offer Marshall a spot on your sofa ❤️**
