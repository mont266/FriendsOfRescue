☁️☁️ FREDDIE’S APPEAL ☁️☁️

Freddie is a wee dote and adores company of both people and dogs but he is a really anxious wee man. When people visit the home, or come into his space it sets of his anxiety and he barks and gets very distressed 😞

We want a nice understanding family who will allow him time to settle, understand him and work with him. He is a young boy and it’s heartbreaking to see but we are confident with the right home he will do just great 😊 


We will need a home with no young kids, can live with or without another dog (pending meet and greet) and someone who is at home most of the day ✔️ 


**Please get in touch if you can offer Freddie a home 🏡**
