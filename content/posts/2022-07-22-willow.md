🌈🌈 WILLOW’S APPEAL 🌈🌈

What is wrong with our wee Willow? She is amazing. Anyone would be lucky to have her ❤️

This beautiful girl is Willow, she is 7 months old and completely deaf 
Being deaf is merely a clinical diagnosis and with a few adaptions at home, deaf dogs lead very full and normal life. She is happy, healthy and a typical pup 🐶

Willow has settled amazingly in foster and gets on incredibly well with the resident dog and cats. She is a clever wee cookie and is already picking up her commands with hand signals 👍🏼


Willow is a very sociable girl and will need to be rehomed where there is canine company, and an active family with no children under 10. Deaf experience is preferred as it would be so beneficial to her development✔️

**Please get in touch if you can offer Willow her forever home 🏡**
