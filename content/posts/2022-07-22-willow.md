> This beautiful girl is Willow, she is 5 months old and completely deaf


Being deaf is merely a clinical diagnosis and with a few adaptions at home, deaf dogs lead very full and normal life. She is a happy, healthy and typical pup 🐶

Willow has settled amazingly in foster and gets on incredibly well with the resident dog. She is a clever wee cookie and although only having been here a few days she is already picking up her commands with hand signals 👍🏼


Willow is a very sociable girl and will need to be rehomed where there is canine company, and active family with no children under 10. Deaf experience is preferred as it would be so beneficial to her development✔️
