Our beautiful Persian girl is now ready for her new home after her recovery from her surgery 🐱

Daphne has been in foster with an experienced Persian cat owner and has been doing extremely well and we have got some useful information that will now help us find her perfect home 🏠

Daphne's needs ⬇️

🔸A home that she can be the only cat (indoor only) she’s very friendly with humans just not felines 

🔸No dogs as it would stress her out 

🔸No young children as she’s pretty quiet 

🔸Definitely needs long hair feline experience, needs brushed everyday (her coat is matted, so we are working on that 😉) 

Whoever rehomes Daphne will need to also keep a close on eye on her toileting as she suffers with stress induced UTI’S as well as kidney stones and although we have this issue well under control it may be something she will suffer with throughout her life ✔️

**Please get in touch to offer Daphne a home 🏡**
