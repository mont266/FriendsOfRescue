> This beautiful Persian princess is Daphne and she is approx 2 years old 

![](https://ucarecdn.com/699ea40a-9423-489a-b09e-7af6b8869dce/)

Daphne was surrendered to us after kidney stones, UTI and other medical issues in general which were causing a lot of mental stress and financial stress on the family. The family done all they could and she was very well taken care off so please be mindful.

This girl needs a pretty chilled home. Stress seems to bring on this girl's issues and although she has had her surgery and right now is still in our vets getting treatment and recovering, we need to keep her stress levels low to ensure a complete recovery. 

We are still seeking a foster home and here are the requirements ⬇️ 

* A quiet home 
* No kids 
* No dogs (or well mannered cat friendly dogs) 
* Preferably no cats or cats that keep themselves to themselves and aren’t bothered with a pretty Persian lady living in their home 😉
* Long haired feline experience 

She is such a affectionate beautiful lady and we can’t wait to get her well and get her settled in to her new home when we find it 🏡 

**Please get in touch if you can help**
