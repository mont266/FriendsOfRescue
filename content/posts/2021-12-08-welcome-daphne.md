Daphne came to us a few months ago, and she wasn't in the best condition. Her long hair was quite badly matted, so although she would have to wait a little longer we wanted to be sure and find her a home with breed experience to be sure she was in the best hands 🤗


Thankfully, the perfect home came along and Daphne now lives with fellow Persians Polly and Reggie. Daphne can be easily stressed, but with patience and love from her foster mum, Daphne was set up well for her forever home and she has been settling great since the move. She slept on the bed with her new mum on her first night and took an instant liking to her new cat tree 🌳


**We’re not sure you’ll need much of it, but wishing you the best of luck Daphne ❤️**
