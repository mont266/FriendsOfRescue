Rosie is a wee pet, who came from a loving home but their health just wasn’t up to a dog never mind a puppy, so thankfully they came to us for help 🙏🏻

Rosie is a typical baby dog, full of love, cheekiness and attention seeking ways. Like all our puppies, she will be rehomed ideally with other dogs, no long working hours and our compulsory puppy classes included in adoption pack ✔️ 

Welcome Rosie posie ❤️
