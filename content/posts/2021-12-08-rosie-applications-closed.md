Our little Rosie is home with her new sisters‚Ä¶.look at that wee trio of happiness ‚ù§Ô∏è

She was playing away today and now snoozing contently on the sofa. She has settled in so well and has landed on all 4 paws üêæ


We had a lot of interest for wee Rosie so it was tough to narrow down but I think everyone will agree that she has found her perfect match and that‚Äôs all that matters ‚ò∫Ô∏è


Good luck Rosie Posie ‚ù§Ô∏è
