Lilly is very sweet and affectionate. Loves humans. Love snuggling up on the sofa or in bed 🤗
Lilly loves playtime and would play fetch for hours if you let her 🥎
Full of puppy energy. Needs plenty of physical and mental stimulation. She has picked up basic commands extremely quickly, she's so smart 👩‍🏫 
Breed experience would be preferred. Ok with dog friendly cats. Good with other dogs but she does like to shout at them to come play with her. 
Older kids only as she likes to jump up to say hello to her humans ✔️ 
Please SHARE or PM the page if you would like to offer Lilly a home 🏠
