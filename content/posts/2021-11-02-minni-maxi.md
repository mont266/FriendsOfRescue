> #### **This absolutely gorgeous boy is Maxi and he came us in very sad circumstances.**

His dad passed away and he was left alone with his siblings.

His daddy's partner has lovingly cared for for Maxi and his siblings but couldn't adopt them as her own doggy isn't a fan of cats. Due to a horrible family dispute Maxi and his siblings were at risk of being put out on the street. His daddy's partner went above and beyond for these babies and entrusted them to our care üê±

Maxi is used to a multi cat household but he wasn't particularly bonded with any of his siblings. Minnie he isn't a fan of kittens and their madness üß∂ 

He is a very sweet boy who has really come out of his shell since he's had his own wee space in foster. 
His foster says anyone who adopts him will be so very lucky as he is such an affectionate boy, he just wants to make biscuits and get pets when he isn't snuggled up in a cosy corner. At 7 years old he is a calm and settled boy who just wants to be loved ü•∞
