> These 2 gorgeous big boys are looking for a home together or separately. After losing their dad and having a horrible old time they all deserve it 🐱

Both are super placid. Minni is the more confident and affectionate of the 2 and will jump up to be petted or if he hears something that may sound like food he's there in a flash. Maxi is independent most of the time, often being found in the bottom of his foster mum's wardrobe doing his own thing 🐾 He's is more shy and will not approach you too often, however when he does, he too loves getting petted and cuddled 🥰

Both are from a multi cat household and would adjust just fine ✔️

**Please get in touch if you can offer either of them (or both of them) a new home 🏠**
