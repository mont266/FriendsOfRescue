Everyone meet 8 week old Sandy, Diva and Buster. A lot of people are asking what breed they are and truth be told they are ‘Heinz 57’ so they are just themselves 🥰


These little ones are happy, confident loving little puppies and we can’t wait to see what the future holds for them. They also had all their puppy medical work completed today ✔️ 


To help with all these medical costs please contact our vets Vets4Pets Crescent Link in person or via phone on 02871314420 or click our PayPal link below 👇🏻

Although these little ones aren’t ready just yet we are taking suitable applications so please read their requirements ⬇️ 


• Ideally have a playful dog/s already in the home  
• No long working hours  
• Plenty of time, patience and love 


**Please get in touch if you would like to offer one of these babies a home 🏡**
