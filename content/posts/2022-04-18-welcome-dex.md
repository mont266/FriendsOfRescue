Dex is a typical big puppy who just loves a good carry on. Such a lovely temperament and is having a great time getting to know his furry foster sister Daisy 🐶

Dex was neutered and all outstanding medical work completed. 
Dex will be available for rehoming after his assessment period is complete ✔️
