This fella is Loki and he is a 1 year old cockapoo ❤️

Loki was surrendered to us a few days ago, thankfully he was very much loved, it was just a very sad situation so please be kind ☺️


Loki has been neutered since his arrival (stand to long and we would neuter you too 🥜 😆) and has been settling brilliantly into foster with doodle foster sister Luna 🐶

Loki would suit a home with another playful pupper and someone who is at home more than not. He is active and enjoys lots of adventures and cuddles 🥰 


Welcome to the family Loki ❤️
