As a cockapoo, he was a man in high demand, and we were so thankful he was surrendered to us in the first place by his family to keep him out of the hands of greedy breeders 🤬


Neutered and ready to go we managed to find him an amazing family. Although he has great manners in waiting for treats with humans, he doesnt extend this to his new fur sister Matilda. Constantly stealing sticks and toys from each other they have both met their match, but they are the best of buds 🥰


**You wont need it, but best of luck in your new forever home Loki 🏡**
