> *This pretty little gal is Pigeon and shes actually a cat 😆* 

Our little Pigeon has been adopted 🤗


Pigeon didnt have to wait to long to find her perfect home and she now lives with her new family including feline sisters Marie and Maisie, and canine sister Millie 🏡


She has settled in the best, instantly just being her usual vocal self and her new Mum says she just loves a cuddle 😻


Best of luck wee woman, we are so happy for you 💗
