> *This pretty little gal is Pigeon and shes actually a cat 😆* 

Pigeon is approx 10 months old, all her medical work is complete so this little love is ready to find herself a forever home 🏡

Pigeon is settling brilliantly in foster, she is very affectionate, and overall just a lovely little girl so she will make somebody very lucky to have her. She can live with dogs, other cats and cat savvy children ✔️

**Please get in touch if you can offer Pigeon a home** ❤️
