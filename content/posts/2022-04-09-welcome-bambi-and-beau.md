When dogs come in pairs it often takes a little longer for them to be rehomed, but for these two it was so worth the wait 💗

Bambi and Beau now live with their new mum and dad and human sisters and they are thriving. They instantly settled into their new routine when they moved, and have been enjoying runs about the garden, a bit of training, playtime with their siblings and of course an abundance of snuggles 🤗
