It didn’t stop me from making discoveries thankfully, its how i am so smart. Foster momma must not be as smart or as good at discoveries as Arnold, because she has to take classes. She goes to class in the living room and looks at a box. Now sometimes this box sounds like a hooman and this confuses Arnold. It was a black box and didnt look like a hooman so when foster mum slack off to make herself some tea, i took my opportunity. I shove chair out of the way to get a closer look. This is where i learn its a box with lots of pushy things on it, and when i jump up, it was like magic. I land on the pushy things with my paws and all these tiny hooman heads appeared in little squares and they start doing the giggles. I still have no idea how they got in there, foster momma was too embarrassed and apologising to the little people to explain it to me. She said dogs and zoom dont mix so i will be stayin the hell away from whatever zoom is. Anyway, i hope tiny humans are ok in there🤞🏼

If you have a home with no zoom i would love to move in. My foster says I’m lovely, I’m super friendly and I’m such a special character that anybody would be very lucky to have me. She forgot that I’m also very smart and good at discoveries. And since my tail is very nearly all better, rescue lady said i need to add in what sort of home i want ⬇️



✅ Lovely hoomans, old or young, but not super young because im a big boy, so 6+ and used to dogs          

✅ Willing to provide snacks

✅ Another doggy friend because i prefer their company

✅ Can give good belly rubs

❌ Im not allowed a cat to chase



Can all tiny hoomans in the boxes please SHARE or PM if your a proper hooman that enjoys the giggles and can give me a forever home 🏡
