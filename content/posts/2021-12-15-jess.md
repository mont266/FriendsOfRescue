Jess is adjusting to life as an indoor dog and she is just loving it 🥰


Jess was down at our vets today for an advocate, vaccines, chip and spay ✔️


This wee love would be best suited to a pet free home where she can relax and enjoy her twilight years. She loves people, is very chilled and relaxed at home (unless there's treats involved) and she’s generally just a pleasure to have ❤️


We love a Staffy and Jess is no exception 🥰


**Please get in touch if you can offer wee Jess a forever home 🏠**
