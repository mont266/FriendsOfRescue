Jess is settling brilliantly into her new home and after a week or 2 of climatising and adjusting it’s like she has been there forever ❤️

Jess’ folk came asking specifically for a Staffy having had one before which we love, because once you have a Staffy you know how amazing they are and our Jess is no exception 😍
