Dougal came to us from the pound and has been settling well in foster and is now on the lookout for a family of his own 💙


Dougal is just a BFG, he loves human company, he is affectionate and loves a cuddle on the sofa. He is very gentle and aware of his size in the house, but he is strong on the lead and needs a little training or he will try and walk you 😆


Dougal would prefer his home to be his own space so he isn't suitable to live with other dogs or cats, but with his gentleness he can live with dog savvy children who have a good understanding of larger breeds ✔️


**Please get in touch if you can to offer this big boy his forever home 🏡**
