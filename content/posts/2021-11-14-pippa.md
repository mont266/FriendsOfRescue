Our wee pippa finally has a brand new home ❤️

This little dote captured the hearts of one of our yorkie loving families who had previously adopted our wee Sunny only a short while ago but he passed away very suddenly with a tumour in his spleen 💔

So although we know our babies can’t be replaced you can start again with another Fur baby to start new memories with and remember the old ones fondly 🌈 

Best of luck Pippa sweetie 😘

Rest in peace wee Sunny ❤️
