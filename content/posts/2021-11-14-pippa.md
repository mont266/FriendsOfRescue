> This little dote is Pippa, and she is a 7 year old yorkie

Pippa is a sweet wee pet and just adores company and cuddles. She’s quiet and so gentle. She has the odd play, but she’s not a fetch and bring it back type of gal 🤣

Sometimes she can be a little nervous and unsure when you go to give her a pet, especially if you move fast, but she does love a good belly rub. She loves a walk and is very clever too, and she’ll tell you when she needs out and when she wants a wee treat. She worked out where they were in her foster home no problem 😉

We would like a quiet home for Pippa, ideally someone who’s at home most of the time to keep her company. Pippa can live with dog savvy kids over 12, and preferably a dog free home ✔️

Please get in touch to offer Pippa her new start ❤️
