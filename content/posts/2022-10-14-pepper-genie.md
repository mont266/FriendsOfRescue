🐶🐶 PUPPY APPEAL 🐶🐶


**These little beauties are Pepper (black and white) and Genie and they are 10 weeks old and their mama is a golden doodle 🥰**


These girls will grow to be medium-large 📏


These 2 were a part of a litter of 10, sadly 2 of them passed away and the other 6 were rehomed privately but thankfully these girls came to us with their mum so we can do it our way ✔️

Both of these girls have beautiful personalities, full of fun and curiosity and so keen to learn. We will be looking for nice active families with plenty of time and some canine company would be lovely too. These girls will NOT be rehomed together.\

Please read our requirements as we won’t be responding to
any unsuitable applicants who don’t read the full appeal❗️


**Please get in touch to offer these girls a home 🏡**
