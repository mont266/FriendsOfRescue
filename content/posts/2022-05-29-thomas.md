> *This handsome lad is Thomas and he is approx 2 years old 😻*

Thomas came to us as an injured stray. Thankfully some kind soul had seen him about her street and grew concerned by his infected wound and brought him to safety 😇

The wound on his neck stank of infection, so this poor man wouldve been in a lot of pain. But he has since underwent surgery to clean and stitch him up, and of course while we are at it we removed his 🥜 ✔️

Thomas has been recovering well and settling in with plenty tlc and enjoying his home comforts in foster. Finally he is safe and no longer in pain🙏🏼
