**‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è ADOPTION NEWS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è**


We couldn't believe that this so freaking handsome boy waited for so long to find his forever home so we're very pleased we can say that Thomas has now been adopted üéà

He was a little timid as first but quickly settled in. His new mummy says he's given them quite a few laughs as he's a maniac. He was quite independent when he arrived, probably since he was found as an injured stray but he's so affectionate now he's let his guard down with his forever hoomans, and that just warms our hearts ü•∞

**Good luck in your new home Thomas ‚ù§Ô∏è**
