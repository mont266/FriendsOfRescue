**🌼🌼 DAISY 🌼🌼**

> This little babe is Daisy and she is only 7 months old 😍

Daisy has settled brilliantly into foster and is just one of those amazing all rounder kinda pooches 🐶

Daisy is smart, well mannered (wee bit mad) and just the best girl 🥰

Daisy definitely needs doggy company. She can also live with kids 5+ but this is purely because she can be bouncy! 

**Please get in touch to offer Daisy her new start ❤️**
