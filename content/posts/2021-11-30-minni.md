For those that haven't read Maxi's appeal, they came us in very sad circumstances 😞

Their dad passed away and they was left all alone. His daddy's partner has lovingly cared for for Minni and his siblings but couldn't adopt them as her own doggy isn't a fan of cats. Due to a horrible family dispute these boys were at risk of being put out on the street. His daddy's partner went above and beyond for these babies and entrusted them to our care.

Minni is used to a multi cat household but is also grand being an only cat and stealing all your attention. He is a confident and affectionate big boy 🥰

Older cats always sit in rescue for much longer than kitten and we can never understand why because they have so much love to give their new family ❤️

Please get in touch if you could offer Minni his furever home 🏡
