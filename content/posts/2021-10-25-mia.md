Tiny Mia is only 3kg and very nervous. So she is looking for a quiet home, on her own or with another placid, preferably older pet 🐶

She needs an understanding family who can work with her quiet shy nature and bring out the best in her ❤️
Because of her nervous nature Mia cannot be rehomed with children under 12. Mia has had all her medical work done and is ready for a soft seat in her retirement home ✔️

**Please get in touch if you can offer Mia a home 🏡**
