> *This precious wee gal is Dizzy and she is 15 years young üòª*

Dizzy came to us in quite sad circumstances. She has had a stable and loving home since she was a kitten but unfortunately her owner had to move and wasnt able to take her beloved Dizzy with her ü•∫

She was at the vets for a wee health check, she is a little thin and so is having her bloods tested but overall she is in good shape for her age ‚úîÔ∏è

Dizzy is settling into her foster home and showing how incredibly affectionate she is. She loves human attention and cuddles, and has been enjoying the company of her new furry friends. It just warms our heart that at her age and having lost all shes ever known, that she is so trusting and accepting of the TLC on offer üíó
