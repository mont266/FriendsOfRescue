Dizzy came to us in quite sad circumstances. She had a stable and loving home since she was a kitten but unfortunately her owner had to move and wasnt able to take her beloved Dizzy with her 🥺

Dizzy settled into her foster home great and showed how incredibly affectionate she was. She loved human attention and cuddles, and enjoyed the company of her new furry friends. It just warmed our heart that at her age of 15 and having lost all she had known, that she was so settled and trusting of the TLC on offer from her foster family 💗

Dizzy had some concerning results from her liver count. She was put on medication and although she showed improvement, gained weight and became very comfortable, while we were awaiting results on further tests this wee lady slipped over the rainbow bridge in her sleep. We take a comfort in knowing that she was content enough in her foster home to let go. We wish we had a little longer with her, but the time we had was precious ❤️

**Sleep tight little lady, you were so loved 🌈**
