Spud was left at a vets with a badly broken leg but thankfully rather than PTS he was surrendered to rescue 🙏🏼

He needed an amputation, so now we have what can only be described as the cutest little tripawd dude on earth. Because hes so young it hasnt taken a wrinkle out of him, it will cause him no further issues and he will lead a full and happy life 🤗

Spud is just a typical kitten who loves his cuddles and wants to play with his fosters dogs. Spud would rather live in a home with other cats or dogs that are used to cats. He will need to be an indoor only cat. He would make a great family pet ✔️
