> *Our little tripawd Spud has been adopted 🤗*

This wee cutie was a very popular boy, but there was only one spud to go round. He now lives with former FOR man Pablo and his canine brother Seb 🏡

Spud has recovered so well from his surgery and now he is just loving life. He is becoming more and more playful everyday and is enjoying the company of his human siblings. But when he slips off for a wee snooze he can be found on the fluffy rug or pinching the dogs bed 😆

**All the best wee Spud, it was our pleasure** ❤️
