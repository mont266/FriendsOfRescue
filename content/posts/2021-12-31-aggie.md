These two skinnys are Arnold and Aggie. Yet another couple of greyhounds discarded by the racing industry 😡

We wish more people would understand that greyhounds are the same as any cockapoo or labradoodle, they are not a money making commodity. They have the same feelings and emotions as any kind of breed and are just as deserving of love warmth and comfort as any other dog on the planet 🐶

Aggie is a wee brindle beauty, she is shy and very gentle. She hasnt had the best appetite, and has struggled with her spay and become slightly withdrawn in her recovery. She is taking a little bit more time to heal emotionally and learn how to be loved. She plucks on our heart strings, but we are just letting her set the pace and she will blossom in her own time. We can only ever know so much about their history, but aggie is a classic example of the mental trauma that can occur from life as a racer 🥺

Greyhounds are gentle, quirky, surprisingly lazy and make the most amazing pets. These two are both approximately 6 or 7 years old so they are a little later in starting their life, but they are safe now and learning how to dog with their wonderful foster. 🐶

They initially found comfort from each other when first rescued, but have since found their own way to do things and will be REHOMED SEPARATELY when the time is right 🙂

✔️ They can live with dog savvy kids\
✔️ They can live with other dogs\
❌ They cannot live with cats or small furries

**Please get in touch if you want to offer one of these love bugs a forever home 🏡**
