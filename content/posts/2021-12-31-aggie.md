Aggie came to us traumatised from her previous life in greyhound racing, and she spent her first while in foster trying to hide and not be noticed😭

Over time, with patience and dedication from her amazing foster she began to eat better, she started to sleep outside her crate and she learned that love and kindness exists ❤️‍🩹

Aggie, now called Maisie, lives with her spaniel sister Maggie. The two of them are getting on great, and make great companions for one another.

 Maggie was adopted with similar mental scars from a past life, so when her mum messaged us we knew straight away that there was no better place for our gal to blossom 🌸

**Best of luck our beautiful girl, were so glad you’ve found the home you always deserved ❤️**
