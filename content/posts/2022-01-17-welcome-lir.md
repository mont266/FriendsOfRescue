> **This dream pup is Lir and he is a 5 month old GSD 🥰**




![](https://ucarecdn.com/d25aaead-919b-478e-b030-f56d9103eb8c/)

Lir was found with 4 siblings, living in a field on their own. Skinny, smelly and breeding 😞


Thankfully all have been saved and are now settling into their chosen rescues and Lir is settling well into foster with us 😌


Lir is being fed little and often to get him built up the right way. He is soft, engaging, sweet and gentle. Just a beautiful natured wee pup 🐶 


We can’t wait to see what the future holds for this wee man. Lir will be available for rehoming after his assessment period next week ✔️ 


Huge thank you to the lovely Bernie for fancying this smelly boy up 💇🏻‍♂️ 


**Welcome Lir ❤️**
