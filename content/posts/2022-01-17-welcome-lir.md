> *Lir our Handsome GSD pup has been adopted 🤗*

Lir was one of four siblings found living in a field on their own, skinny, breeding and very smelly. His brothers and sisters have been rehomed with other rescues so were glad to finally confirm our boys happy ending as he will stay with his foster family forever 🏡

Lir settled in the best, with his foster instantly saying she has never met a dog like him. He is a typical GSD in that hes smart, loyal and oh so handsome. He lives with his best friend and massive feline brother Púca who is very much his boss 🐈‍⬛


We have loved the pupdates from Lirs family, mostly after beach trips, where he is at his happiest as he’s surrounded by seaweed. He loves it that much they have used it as distraction amongst their training techniques and have given him the title of Official Cute Furry Officer of Seaweed 😆


**You really don’t need it, but wishing you all the luck in a seaweed filled world big man ❤️**
