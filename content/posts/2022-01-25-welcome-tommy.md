Tommy came to us, very scared and unsure. He is completely blind and so took a little longer to realise he was safe in his foster home. Now he knows, he is the cuddliest boy and loves nothing more than a snuggle on the sofa 🥰

As Tommy is a little older he didn’t heal the best after his neuter, but thanks to the TLC from his foster and our amazing volunteers who helped with his transport to his appointments he is all healed up and stitches are coming out on sunday 🙏🏼


Tommy is a typical EBT and as is so common he can be misunderstood because of his looks. But this lad is one of the sweetest boys you can meet. Anybody that has been lucky enough to meet him has instantly fallen in love ❤️

Tommy seeks alot of reassurance from humans due to his blindness so he will need a calm household where someone is home with him for most of the day. He is super gentle, but he bumps into things and at 30 kilos he isnt suitable to live with young children. Tommy is fine with other calm dogs and cats, although any cats would need to be indifferent to dogs so as not to bother him ✔️
