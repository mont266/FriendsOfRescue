Tommy came to us after finding himself in the pound where he did not cope well since hes completely blind 😭


However its not something that holds him back as he is the most lovable gentle soul who loves nothing more than a wee carry on and a cuddle on the sofa 🤗


Tommy now has a 10 furry siblings, all of which are rescued guinea pigs and rabbits (see below 😩). He has settled so well into his new home, loving his wee walks to meet his dad at work and snuggling up on the sofa, it just warms our heart to see ❤️

**All the best Tommy, we are so happy to see you settled in your forever home 🏡**
