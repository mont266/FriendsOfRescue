Tommy unfortunately found himself in the pound and to make matters worse he is completely blind 😞


What a confusing time for him so as you can imagine he is pacing and unsettled but he will come round. Typical to the breed, he is a gentleman and he is soft, kind and affectionate. He is just looking for a best friend 🤗 


We wanted to let Tommy settle before a vet check so will get him in this week for an MOT ✔️ 


We don’t know much about Tommy in regards to other dogs etc but for now all we want is for him to feel safe to be himself, and his foster mum is doing a great job 👏🏻 


**Welcome to the pack Tommy ❤️**
