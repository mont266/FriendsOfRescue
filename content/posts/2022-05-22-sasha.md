**‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è ADOPTION NEWS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è**

Our wee Sasha has finally got her happy ending ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is Sasha's second time being rehomed with us, through no fault of her own, and this time it‚Äôs for keeps üòç

Sasha is a weirdly wonderful fluffer and she had landed on all 4 paws with an amazing family who love her flaws and all, and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about ‚ò∫Ô∏è

**Best of luck Sasha ‚ù§Ô∏è**
