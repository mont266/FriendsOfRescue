Sasha is a wee dote and has settled brilliant into foster 🐶 


Please read Sasha’s bio before applying ⬇️ 


We need an experienced home with no children, and no children coming in. Sasha has been moved around so much she has no confidence in people coming or going. A quiet home would suit her. She could live with another dog if introduction goes well but would be quite happy as an only dog. She's not fussed meeting dogs on the lead but when she was off lead at the beach or in a field she is in her element running about and doesn't show any aggression. She's like a different dog. We want someone who will spend time with her and work with her, she's very affectionate but needs a bit of guidance…..don’t we all 🤭


**Please get in touch if you can offer Sasha a home 🏡**
