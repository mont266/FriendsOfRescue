> This little cutie pie was found in the middle of nowhere, starving and alone at 5/6 weeks old 😞

She is a sassy little hisser (complete with murder mittens) but it’s hard to take seriously when she is the size of a 50p 😆

This little one has now been wormed and albeit to young for much else she is settling into foster where ‘forced love’ will be the approach 😉

Welcome little pretty kitty Nugget ❤️
