This little toot was found as a stray at a very young vulnerable age but my goodness she has always been a little sass queen 👸🏻


Her fosters done an amazing job with her. From medical needs to tlc, she turned out an affectionate well rounded little lady 🥰


Little Nugget has settled very well into family life and her folk adore her…..sigh 😻


Good luck sweetie ❤️
