> *Our bulldog lady Daphne is 4 years old and finally seeking a forever home 🏡*

She came to us a few weeks ago after having spent her life in a cage to line peoples pockets on a puppy farm. Thankfully, that is a world she has left behind, and she has since been spayed, had a splenectomy, and her skin and sores have come on the best 🙏🏼

Daphne is a loveable squish, she loves nothing more than a good snore on the sofa, cuddles, and her beloved squeaky ball 🎾

Daphne is suitable to live with other calmer dogs, kids that are dog savvy and she can also live with cats ✔️
