> *Our Daphne is home ❤️*

This gal is a bloody cracker, best wee lady and an allrounder. Her new family are in love with her already 🥰


Her very experienced new home are British bulldog owners so understand the health concerns and everything there is to know about bulldogs including how lovable and great they are. Daphne now has 2 bully siblings but of course she is alpha and that works out for everyone 😉

We have no doubt Daphne will miss her foster brother Jake even if they didn't start out as friends 😅 but stay tuned for a tear jerker later this evening 😥


**Best of luck Daffers, it was a total pleasure ❤️**
