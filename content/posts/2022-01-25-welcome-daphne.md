> *So yesterday we got in a discarded breeding pair üò°*




![](https://ucarecdn.com/316582ea-6ca8-42ef-a5db-503dc384126d/)

A 3/4 year old male and female British Bulldog. These 2 have now been separated for a much needed time out. They are no longer cash cows they are not working for their shitty keeper to make money off them. 
Where do we even begin‚Ä¶.
Firstly we would like to talk about the smell of them. The journey was broken up with 2 drivers and both needed a valet after, it would have made you sick. 
We will start with our little lady, the newly named Daphne, who is 3 years old. On meeting Daphne you hear her awful breathing, you will see her teets dragging on the ground. You will see her red inflamed skin, with dermatitis and green ooze dripping from every skin fold that has never been cleaned or treated. She has inter digital cysts all over her body (video in comments). She is also urinating blood which is likely caused by untreated UTI‚ÄôS. And lastly this lady was so stressed out, so worried that the last litter of 6 babies she had she ate 3 of them. This is something that happens in extreme situations of stress and distress and a rotten puppy farm/backyard breeder is exactly that.
This is likely why this gorgeous, sweet gentle lady has lost her job. She is no longer useful. Not bringing in enough money üò°

Anyway, she is now here with us. That will be the last litter that will be ripped off her. That will be the last time a male will be forced on her and the last time she will ever be someone‚Äôs commodity.


**Daphne you are now safe with us, and we will get you fixed up your happy ending isn‚Äôt far away ‚ù§Ô∏è**
