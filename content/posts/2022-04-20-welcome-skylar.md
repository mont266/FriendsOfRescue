> *This beautiful girl is Skylar and she is a 16 month old Saluki mix 😍*

Skylar came to us from the pound, she was running a fever, terrified and incredibly shut down. But after plenty of TLC from her foster mum, and a wee holiday to herself in Donegal she is now ready to find a home to call her own 🏡

Skylar is an incredibly gentle wee soul. Her confidence is growing all the time, she loves getting out for wee walks, but not as much as snuggling up under a blanket on the sofa to watch some Disney. She is very sweet and placid in nature, and although a little timid, her personality shines through with those she trusts and you can't help but love her. She is just such a sweetheart 💗

Skylar needs a quiet and relaxed home with no young children. She is very docile and chilled, so she can happily be the only pet or she could also live with a similarly natured calm dog ✔️

***Please get in touch if you can offer Skylar a cosy spot on your sofa ❤️***
