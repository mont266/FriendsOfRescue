> *This angel is Skylar, she is an 18 month old whippet/saluki mix and she is so shut down 💔*

Skylar has come from a pound facility and she just doesn’t know what’s going on and who can blame her. When she arrived she had a temp of 40 and was quite unwell. She also had a bad cough, we were worried initially about lungworm, but thankfully she's clear of that, but does have a bad dose of kennel cough. She hasn’t had an easy time of it 🥺

She was collected today to go to foster and she is constantly trying to hide her wee face. She is just so afraid and it’s heartbreaking to see. Thankfully she is warming to her foster and has been sitting on the sofa but we will be taking this stunning girl slow and steady before her spay surgery etc takes place. Lots of TLC ❤️
