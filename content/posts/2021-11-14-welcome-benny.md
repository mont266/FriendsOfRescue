> *After months and months of treatment our wee Benny is finally ready for the next leg of his journey ☺️*

Benny is an elderly bichon frise at 11/12 years old. Until rescue he had been living outdoors/garage so has been learning about indoor comforts. He loves to watch the world go by from the back of a sofa at a window 🧐

Like many of us older folk Benny is overweight, arthritic, sometimes grumpy and has sensitive skin issues. He is on life long meds to relieve his health problems and his grumpiness isn’t just as bad now he’s feeling much better. However he will settle best in a quiet dog free home or possibly with another senior dog and a human companion who is around a lot. Benny isn’t a lap dog but does need to know where his human is. He just adores a good old ear scratch and head rub while looking up with those expressive eyes 😍

He's a very happy boy for all his pain, he loves his short, frequent walks and responds well to praise. However he could and would eat for Ireland meaning diet is important. He likes vegetables and is fed them in his dinner and as treats 🥕 Benny has been fine with people of all ages but has displayed intolerance to young playful dogs who perhaps bounced too close to his weary bones. He walks with a limp but is more agile than would be expected with so many sore joints. Benny deserves to be spoiled and loved for the rest of his twilight years 🐶
