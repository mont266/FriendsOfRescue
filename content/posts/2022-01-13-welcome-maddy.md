> *Our Maddy has been adopted by her foster family ❤️*

Maddy came into our care, very smelly, badly matted, and with a skin and ear infection. She is a very sweet girl, but was a little nervous to begin with so it took her a little while to come round in her foster home. But once she did it was clear she was going nowhere 🏡

Maddy, now called Gigi, lives with Bear her spaniel brother. Theyre both quite independent doggos but have softened their resolve and now quite happily sleep beside each other on the sofa! Normally after Maddy has emptied the toy box 🧸


**Good luck our little springer lady, but we’re pretty sure you don’t need it ❤️**
