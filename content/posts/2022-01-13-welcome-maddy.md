> *This little tiny little springer lady is Maddy and she is 2 years old 😍*

She is such a sweet wee girl who is taking her rescue experience in her stride. Maddy has very sore skin, very badly matted and smelly. She was spayed, vaccinated, chipped and worm/flead yesterday and she is settling well in foster ✔️

We are sure this lady won’t stick around long 😍
