Lola was surrendered to us yesterday and has been settling brilliantly into foster. 
She is a very sweet little girl who just loves company of people and is also doing well with foster's doggy 🐶


We are letting this little love settle and next week she will be vet checked and any outstanding vet work will be done ✔️ 


**Welcome to the family sweetie ❤️**
