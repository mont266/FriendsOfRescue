> ***This lovely wee girl is Lola and she is a wee Frenchie 😍***

Our cute little 2 year old Frenchie lady Lola is now ready for her new home 🏡 


Lola has been the most perfect little girl in foster. She loves carrying on with her foster brother Beau and generally loves a bit of craic but also stacks of cuddles 🥰 


This wee dote will be a great addition to one very lucky family ❤️


Lola can live with kids 8+ and other dogs ✔️ 


Please get in touch to offer Lola her new home 🏡
