Like all frenchies Lola was bred with more importance on how she looks than how she can breathe….so she underwent surgery to widen her nostrils and may also need surgery on her soft palette although its not needed just yet so we will just need to monitor it with her family going forward ✔️


Lola now lives with her new family and fur brother Teddy who is obsessed with her, and who can blame him. She is such a sweet and loving little girl and she has settled the very best, her new mum says she just fits in perfect ❤️

**All the best little Lola, so glad you found the loving home you deserve 🏡**
