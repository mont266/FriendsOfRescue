Harley was rehomed by us 5 years ago but unfortunately due to an awful family illness he has come back to us. Our thoughts and prayers are with his mum and her family who are amazing friends of the page ❤️


Harley is like Benjamin button he is getting younger lol. He is growing old disgracefully, with his pick pocketing, bin hoking ways…and he is absolutely amazing. He is great with other dogs, kids and anyone he meets. He is a brilliant allrounder and will make an absolute fantastic addition to a lucky family 🐶


Harley is a very special boy to us so we are really rooting for him 🤞🏻 


**Please get in touch if you can offer Harley a home 🏡**
