> Bella our little terrier has been adopted 🤗

Wee Bella is a typical terrier, fun, active,  independent and a wee bossy boots. Not helped by the black dog curse, she was with us longer than we would’ve liked, but sometimes the perfect home is just worth waiting for 🏡

Bella now lives with her new mum and in typical Bella fashion the move didn’t taken a wrinkle out of her. She settled instantly and is loving life having her own home where she can rule the roost like she does best 👑

Best of luck with your new mum Bella, the pleasure was all ours ❤️
