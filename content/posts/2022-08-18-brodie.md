> This little dude is Brodie and he is a 5 month old Cocker Spaniel cross 😍

Brodie has arrived with us following a change in his family’s circumstances. Thankfully they turned to rescue as all too often we see pups passed from pillar to post or in the wrong hands altogether 😡

Brodie is a typical pup, full of beans and the joys of spring. He loves people, other dogs and life in general. Now he is ready to find his perfect home 🏡

Brodie is seeking an active home as he loves his walks. Any children must be dog savvy and he will need canine company so there must also be another playful dog in the home ✔️

**Please get in touch if you can offer Brodie a home 🤗**

As always we ask for any help with our veterinary costs, if you can help please see our **[DONATE](https://www.friendsofrescueni.com/donate/)** page for all the ways you can help.
