Our little Willow has been adopted and her dad is utterly in love ![ü•∞](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t43/1.5/16/1f970.png)

An experienced collie owner who sadly lost his wee collie last year and when he saw little Willow (now named Ada) he knew she was the one ![‚ù§Ô∏è](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tf3/1.5/16/2764.png)

Ada is settling in so well and adjusting to her brand new life like she has always been there ![üê∂](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t88/1.5/16/1f436.png)

What a lovely happy ending ![‚ù§Ô∏è](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tf3/1.5/16/2764.png)
