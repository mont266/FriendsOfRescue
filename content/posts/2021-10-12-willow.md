Our little Willow has been adopted and her dad is utterly in love ü•∞

An experienced collie owner who sadly lost his wee collie last year and when he saw little Willow (now named Ada) he knew she was the one ‚ù§Ô∏è

Ada is settling in so well and adjusting to her brand new life like she has always been there üê∂

What a lovely happy ending ‚ù§Ô∏è
