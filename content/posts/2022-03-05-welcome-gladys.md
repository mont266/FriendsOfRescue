Let us introduce you all to Gladys, a beautiful donkey in her 20’s. Her owner died and she has been on her own for a while all alone in a field 🥺


Her feet are very overgrown and she is quite thin but we have her in foster now with a rug on and plenty if grub. Shes nice and cosy in her wee stable 🥰

This girl actually hugged her transporter, she is super affectionate. She loaded onto the horse box not a bother and is meeting all her equine foster siblings and taking in all the newness and help ❤️


When we get this girl all sorted she will be looking for her new home but for now we want to say a huge thank you to our transporter, our foster for allowing us to help a stunning animal like this. We feel extremely honoured to be part of her rescue journey 😊
