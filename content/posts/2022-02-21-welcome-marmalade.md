He was originally trapped for neuter, but he was just so friendly he was clearly once a pet, so he has come to us to find him a new home to call his own 🏡


He has been neutered and vaccinated and is settling well in foster. Hes got a little infection in his eye so hes on drops to clear that up ✔️


Marmalade is a friendly boy and gets on fine with other cats. He can be a little shy to start off with but he loves getting petted and would sit and purr for days ❤️


**Please get in touch if you can offer this beautiful man his forever home 🐈**
