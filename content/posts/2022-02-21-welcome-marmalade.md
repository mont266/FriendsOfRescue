Our beautiful boy Marmalade has been adopted 🐈


Adult cats are often overlooked for kittens, but this purring machine proves what everyone is missing. After having been found as a stray it warms our heart he now has a home to call his own 🏡


Marmalade now lives with his new mum and dad and furry brother Freddy who he’s been getting on great with. It didnt take him long at all to settle in, he was instantly right at home. We think it was just meant to be 😻


All the best wee man, delighted for you ❤️
