We are so pleased to tell you all that our happy, gentle (but strong) giant Obie has been rehomed and it’s a match made in heaven 😍

Obie is a big 46kg lab x yet people were shocked of his size and strength….baffling! So we struggled to find him someone who wasn't put off by his strength. But we knew that he just needed to find "his person" and they in would fall in love and that’s exactly what happened ☺️


Obie Is an old school boy, never on a lead before so pulled like a train on the lead and if you don’t know doggy body language it could be easily mistaken for dog reaction on the lead but the big oaf just wanted to play, he loves dogs, kids and people alike and his new family have landed an absoloutly corker of a dog! 

A great example of the rescue breed ❤️


Obie has landed on all 4 paws and we couldn’t be more pleased for him and his new family 🐾
