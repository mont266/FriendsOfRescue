Obie was surrendered to the pound as his family were moving. Their loss though 🖕🏻

This boy is amazing. He is super affectionate, sweet and would let you throw a ball for him all day long. He gets on with everyone, and be rehomed with older kids (due to his size) and although he needs to loose a bit of timber he is just an all rounder and a perfect example of the rescue breed 🐶

PS everyone who meets him seems to be extremely surprised by his size, and strength (we aren’t at all but maybe that’s just us 😆 but just to clarify he is 48kg of hunky chunk lab 🥰
Whoever gets this boy is one lucky family ❤️
