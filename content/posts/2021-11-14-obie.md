Obie was surrendered to the pound as his family were moving.

This boy was very stressed after his time in the pound and absolutely exhausted because of it but he got a health check and is now settling into foster ‚ò∫Ô∏è

This boy is amazing. He is super affectionate, sweet and would let you throw a ball for him all day long. He gets on with other dogs, kids and although he needs to lose a bit of timber he is just an allrounder and a perfect example of the rescue breed üê∂

Whoever gets this boy is one lucky family ‚ù§Ô∏è
