So this adoption news gets us right in the feels !❤️

This is Frank, he is 16 months old and he was going to be euthanised because he wasn’t a "good worker". We randomly stumbled across him and asked could we take him.

He went to foster, with a view to adopt, but having never been indoors before we didn’t know how it would go or if it would be a match but regardless he was safe.

He settled like a dream, his family fell in love and they are a match made in heaven !❤️

Quite literally from ‘farm to family’ and we couldn’t be happier 🥰

Just brilliant Frank !❤️
