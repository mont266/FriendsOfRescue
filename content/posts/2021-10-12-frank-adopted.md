So this adoption news gets us right in the feels ![‚ù§Ô∏è](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6c/1/16/2764.png)

This is Frank, he is 16 months old and he was going to be euthanised because he wasn‚Äôt a "good worker". We randomly stumbled across him and asked could we take him.

He went to foster, with a view to adopt, but having never been indoors before we didn‚Äôt know how it would go or if it would be a match but regardless he was safe.

He settled like a dream, his family fell in love and they are a match made in heaven ![‚ù§Ô∏è](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6c/1/16/2764.png)

Quite literally from ‚Äòfarm to family‚Äô and we couldn‚Äôt be happier ![ü•∞](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tea/1/16/1f970.png)

Just brilliant Frank ![‚ù§Ô∏è](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6c/1/16/2764.png)
