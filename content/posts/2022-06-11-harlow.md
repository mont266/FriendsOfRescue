Harlow our little staffie gal has been adopted 🤗


Harlow came to us from the pound bearing a few emotional scars that suggested she was previously just used for breeding and never loved. She wasn’t too sure how to be a pet but this lovely wee lady has come such a long way 💗


Harlow now lives with her new Mum and brother Finn. She has settled amazingly well, she loves a wee play but is a lazy sod at the best of times. Her and Finn have been getting on great and the wee tinker has been teaching him to bark at the postman 😆

**All the best sweet girl, we are so happy for you in your new forever home 🏡**
