> *This beautiful black and white lady is Harlow and she is a 2 year old staffy 😍*

Harlow has been settling well in foster although she is showing a few emotional scars of her past so we can only assume she was used and abused to line a breeders pocket 🤬

She was a quite reserved to begin with, she is such a sweet and gentle soul and her confidence is starting to grow in foster. They have described her as a wee lazy bum, she has a great wee personality but isnt too high energy and loves nothing more lying in tight beside them for cuddles and she also fairly dishes out the kisses 😘

Harlow will be spayed on monday and then she will be ready for her new beginning. Harlow loves human company so would prefer no long working hours, she can live with dog savvy children, and other dogs upon a successful meet and greet ✔️

**Please get in touch if you can offer this sweet little lady her forever home** 🏡
