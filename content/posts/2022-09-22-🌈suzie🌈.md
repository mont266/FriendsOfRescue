Our little Suzie is gone 💔

Last Friday, after yet another 3 admissions in one week, a tumour was found in her stomach and we just knew this wee lady couldn’t sustain anymore surgery or upset, it just wasn’t ethical 🥺

Her cancer had spread much quicker than what we could have imagined and her wee 14 year old body was tired and we had to make the awful decision to let her go 💔

Suzie is one of those wee angels that we can never fix the damage people have done to her. 14 years old, absolute shit life of constant breeding until her body couldn’t, then discarding her like rubbish. Her short time with us, albeit comfortable, happy and pain free, can never fix or undo all the damage that was done. We just hope it was enough to let her have a few months of peace and not having to worry about what is happening to her next.

Suzie's foster mum loved the bones of her and Suzie felt the same, they slept in bed together and Suzie always had a paw touching her no matter what the situation. Her foster mummy Leona was definitely her person and that is always something we strive for in rescue. To complete a journey is helping them find their ‘people’ and we are so glad Suzie had that. Leona held Suzie's paw as she crossed to rainbow bridge and it was extremely peaceful, and with no other choices it’s all we can hope for you. Leona, thank you for being for brave for Suzie ❤️

Finally, we would like to thank the charity who made it all possible for Suzie and that’s Schnauzerfest. This charity is such a lifeline for bearded cuties and the animals they have supported in FOR have been some of the most medically in need, which in turn means huge medical bills. They just want to help and it honestly takes so much pressure off us, allowing us to help these babies. You’re very much an extended part of our team we love you and we can’t thank you enough ❤️

Suzie, we have no doubt you made it safely to rainbow bridge, we are just sorry we couldn’t fix it for you 💔

Rest in peace Suzie 🌈
