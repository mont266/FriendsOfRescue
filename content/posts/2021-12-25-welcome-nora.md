Nora originally found herself on scumtree FTGH but thankfully they surrendered her to us to stop her getting into the wrong hands. And now she finds herself in the most perfect home 🏡

Nora, now called Sally, has a few siblings to teach her how to dog and explore with. Her family have her spoilt and say she is a proper clever wee cookie, so we expect her to sail through her puppy classes 🎓

**Good luck wee woman, your new mum told us you are just the best girl, and she couldn’t be more right 💗**
