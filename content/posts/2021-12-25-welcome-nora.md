Is there anything cuter than a big, fuzzy Heinz 57 baby?... 🐶

This beautiful girl is Nora, she is 10 weeks old and unfortunately found herself on ‘scumtree’ FTGH so thankfully her owner agreed to surrender her to rescue 🙏🏻


Nora is just a delight and loves dog and Hoomans alike. Nora could live with dog savvy kids 8+. This pretty girl just wants a carry on and bit of craic. She will make an amazing addition to a loving family 😍


All her medical work has been carried out, and when rehomed she will leave with puppy classes provided in her adoption pack to make sure she grows to be a well rounded happy dog 🐶


**Please get in touch  if you can offer Nora a home 🏡**
