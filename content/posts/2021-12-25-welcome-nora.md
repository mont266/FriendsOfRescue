Is there anything cuter than a big, fuzzy Heinz 57 baby?... 🐶

This beautiful girl is Nora, she is 10 weeks old and unfortunately found herself on ‘scumtree’ FTGH so thankfully her owner agreed to surrender her to rescue 🙏🏻

This pretty girl just wants a carry on and bit of craic. She will make an amazing addition to a loving family 😍

All her medical work was carried out today but she won’t be available for rehoming until after Christmas. We don’t do presents here ❌

Welcome baby Nora ❤️
