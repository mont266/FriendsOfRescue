> *We have some exciting news that we have been bursting to tell you. It has been a slow transition but it’s official…our little Molly has been adopted ❤️*

Molly has had quite the journey with FOR, needing 2 very intricate knees surgeries. One has been completed and the other will be carried out in 2 weeks. We wanted her to be settled so that her 2nd surgery could be carried out in her new home (at our costs) 🏠

Molly has settled so well! Her new family visited in foster a number of times, then there was a few park trips, and eventually a sleepover. Then she just stayed and this time it’s forever ❤️

We managed to successfully fundraise for Molly's surgery for the first knee but it cost more than what we initially expected so now we are going to share her GoFundMe again so we can get the other knee surgery done ✔️ 


This little girl deserves her happy ending, complete with 2 working knees and we are almost there so if you can spare even £1 please click the link below ⬇️
