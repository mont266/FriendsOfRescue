As some of you may remember, Molly surrendered into our care with other animals from the same home. Molly was a nervous wee dote and adopted after several weeks in our care, a short while later Molly escaped from her new owner after a neighbour accidentally let her out. Due to unforeseen circumstances Molly was returned to our care, she was placed in a mulitdog household and has really came out her shell and has a reason not to bolt !‚ò∫Ô∏è

When Molly first came into our care she was skinny and malnourished, nothing a few good meals couldnt sort, or so we thought.‚Ä¶.

Molly soon put the pounds back on, looked happier and healthier, however she had been that malnourished during vital development stages that her muscles didn't develop properly and she has slipping patellas in both hind legs. Whilst she was underweight this wasn't as apparent and at only 20months old this is totally unexpected. Molly will require 3 surgery's on each knee. She has luxating patella, needs wedge ostectomy, imbrication and TTT (see her shocking X-rays below) this is a costly and lengthy process. She can only have one leg done at a time and the recovery for each leg is 6months, so in total that's a year recovery and we cannot keep her in foster for that long, it's not fair on her or her foster family.

So we are appealing for her new home, where we can start her treatment and rehabilitation at our costs obviously üê∂

* Molly needs another dog in the home - she is a crazy playing pocket rocket üöÄ
* Due to her timid nature around humans and her operations she can live with children 12+
* She will need a home dedicated to her recovery
* Molly is good with cats

> We would also like to take this opportunity to ask for any help towards her surgery. We now have enough for 1 knee‚Ä¶half way there! If you can please donate to ‚ÄòMollys Fundraiser‚Äô ‚¨áÔ∏è
