> *Bear our little pom fella has been adopted 💙*

Bear was passed about quite a bit before he came to us, as is often the case with desirable breeds, so many people like the idea of having one with out really understanding the commitment it takes to have a pet 😩

Thankfully, his new home will be his last stop. He now lives with his new mum and dad and he is king of the castle. They had adopted wee Lena from us before who sadly passed over rainbow bridge after having lived her best life with the most wonderful people. And now were so happy that this little man will get to do the same ❤️

Bear, also known as Sir Teddy Bear 😆 has landed on all four paws. He has already been to the Port to get kitted out with more than he’ll ever need, and has had a wee spa day to himself. He follows his parents around the house and literally gazes at them with love 😍

**You wont need an ounce of it, but best of luck Sir Teddy Bear in your forever home** 🏡
