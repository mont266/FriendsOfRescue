> *Our wee Megan arrived with us 5 months ago, and unfortunately she has just not been having a very easy time of it 😞*

When she arrived she had diabetes that has been poorly managed which means she lost her sight. Since then we have struggled to get the right dosage for her, and after a few tests it was established she also had Cushing’s Disease which complicated matters because her meds had to be changed, and yesterday she was diagnosed with pancreatitis 😞


She had come so far, it’s just 2 steps foward and 5 steps back with her sometimes and her fosters are so dedicated to her and her care it’s heartbreaking for everyone. But we are now working around the pancreatitis, and trying to get her on her feet again as she is very flat this weekend which is worrying. We just need all your prayers and well wishes 🙏🏻


We also want to say a massive thank you to Schnauzerfest who have covered all Megan’s veterinary costs since the start. We would have really struggled as her vet costs have been crazy as she has been so poorly so we really can’t thank them enough. We would encourage anyone looking to help out to support them and the work they do 👏🏻


When Megan is well she is such a happy girl despite everything. She deserves so much more than the shit she has endured before she arrived with us, and as always she has our support and help forever ❤️


Here is a few words from her amazing foster family ⬇️


Her various health conditions obviously play a large part in her day to day life, but looking past those we have loved watching her blossom at home. She was very shut down when she came to us and took a long time to accept that she was loved or to ask for love, she has learned how to use her paw to ask for pets or to get up on the sofa. It was a couple of months before we saw any excitement or heard her bark and even now after 5 months we are so happy to see her get excited if one of us walk in the front door or to hear her bark at other dogs on her walk, she can't see them but she can let them know she's there lol! She loves walking in the park, she has freedom there, no worries about falling off the footpath that she can't see or noisy cars coming past and frightening her. She is such a resilient little lady, and it's heartwarming to see glimpses of her personality when she's feeling well.


**Love you Megan ❤️**
