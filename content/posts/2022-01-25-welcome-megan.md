> *One tiny blind Schnauzer, and one huge journey. 6 long months, a diagnosis of diabetes, then cushings and then pancreatitis but with amazing support from 1 very special foster family, our Megan has made it to her new family….with the one and only Ollie from FOR as her new brother ❤️*

Here is a little message from Megan’s new family 🥰


We are so proud of Megan. She has done so, so well navigating her new surroundings and integrating into her new woofer filled family!! And our five wee schnauzers Ronnie, Zippy, Heidi, Sophie and wee Ollie have all been so good with Megs...being patient and giving her space to find her way. She loves lots of gentle attention and paws at us for more. ❤

  We love watching her take herself outside into the garden. Just pottering around and sniffing the air. 🙂 Then marvelling at her ability to successfully navigate her way back inside. She's amazing! I think that most of all Megs is loving her diabetic friendly chicken dinners 😋 nom nom!! We are so thankful for everyone at FoR and grateful for everything that they have done for Megs but also for our wee Ollie. Especially thankful for Megan's foster family. What a privilege to be Megan's Mom and Dad. Thank you for entrusting her into our care and into our family x
We want to say a huge thank to Schnauzerfest for their ongoing support and care for ALL Megan’s medical costs and their continuing support for Megan’s ongoing care. We couldn’t have done it without them. We also want to say a big thank you to Megan’s new family for being so patient with her recovery and waiting until the time was right for Megan. And the biggest thank you goes to Megan’s foster family who has spent the last 6 months up and down to our vet's, arranging vet apps around their young family. Sleepless night with worry, but never giving up. She owes it all to the Browne family and we love you for it ❤️


We will continue to update you all on Megan’s journey as her new family are so dedicated to their furries and just seeing Ollie and the impact their care has made on his whole being is incredible ❤️


**Just thee best news 🥰**
