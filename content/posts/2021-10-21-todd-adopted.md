FINALLY…our beautiful Todd (now named Rudi) has got his happy ending, and like we always say - sometimes it’s worth the wait because his family are perfect 😍

He’s just a black, second-hand greyhound to some people but to them he is their star. They fell in love with his appeal and when they met him it sealed the deal. Days before his adoption they were researching different kinds of enrichment for his new life. Then to top it off we met Rudi and his new family in pets at home getting a set of tall bowls and an orthopaedic bed…..we think he will be just fine 😉

Thank you to his new family for giving a very much needing boy not only a new home, but they saw something that no one else and took a chance on him ❤️

Good luck Rudi 🐶
