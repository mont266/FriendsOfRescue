> This wee baby is Dobby and he is a 12 week old lurcher/whippet baby ❤️

This little man is very spirited lol, he could very easily be the boss of any house and was the litter bully, however he is only a baby and will be easily led so needs proper guidance ☺️

This wee man would be best suited to a home with another dog but no quiet/nervous types, and someone who will be around for company and training.

Like all our pups they come with compulsory puppy classes in their adoption pack so they turn out to be well rounded, well socialised adults. We DO NOT rehome as Christmas presents ✔️ 

**Please get in touch if you can offer Dobby a home 🏡**
