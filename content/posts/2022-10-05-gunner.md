❤️❤️ WELCOME GUNNER ❤️❤️

This beautiful bully is Gunner and he is approx 2 years old 😍

This poor boy has spent quite a while in kennels after being taken from a council pound. We have no idea of his past but we know it wasn’t nice because he always expects the worst. He cowers and hides himself away which is just horrible to see.
He joined his foster family this week and he is absolutely in heaven, like a typically bully on the sofa. He enjoys being snuggled up with his lovely foster family who have been showing him the kindest hands he has probably ever seen 🤗 

**We just know this boy is special 😍** 

**Welcome the family Gunner ❤️**
