Unfortunately Jackie is with us because her owner passed away 💔

On arrival she was vet checked, and this poor little one has barely any vision or hearing. She needs a dental, and bloods checked before surgery which will be done on Friday ✔️

Jackie is settling well in foster despite the upheaval. She is getting lots of tlc and her foster, much like us, is obsessed with her wee frosted face 😍

Welcome sweetheart ❤️
