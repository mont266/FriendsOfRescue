> *This little golden oldie is Jackie, she is an 11 year old JRT, and we are obsessed with her wee frosty face 😍*

Jackie came to us in very sad circumstances when her elderly owner passed away. She has done so well to settle with her wonderful foster mum after having lost everything she had ever known 💔


Jackie is partially blind, but this doesnt hold her back in the slightest. She is very calm and placid, loves her belly rubs and is quite the wee lazy lump who loves nothing more than to snuggle up in her blankets and snooze in front of the fire. 💤

Jackie is looking for a nice calm home where she can put her feet up. She is very loving and gets attached to her human so will need someone who is home with her most of the day. She gets on well with other dogs, she can live with cats and she can also live with children that will allow her peace and quiet for her snoozes. ✔️
