Jackie came to us in very sad circumstances when her elderly owner passed away and she had lost her whole world. But plenty of love, cuddles and snoozes with her foster mum and she came on the best ❤️

Jackie is 11 years old, partially blind, and sadly not a dog that attracts much interest. But to us and to her new family she is just perfect. She is loved for being jackie, and she gets on great with her three hooman siblings and her pug sister who also loves nothing more than a belly rub and a nap on your lap 😴

**It was our pleasure to help you little lady, best of luck in your new forever home 🏡**
