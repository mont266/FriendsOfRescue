Playful and a little goofy. He's a very happy, friendly boy who absolutely loves all people and all dogs ☺️

He loves a run about but equally loves to curl up on the sofa for cuddles with his foster humans. 
He's an extremely lovable wee guy….a good spooning would be up there with his favourite  things 😄

Obi is now giardia clear, and is getting his dew claw/toe removed this week but we are sussing out and getting a lovely home prepared for him for when he is ready. Obi would prefer another playful dog in the home but would be happy as an only dog and he could live with older or dog savvy kids only due to him play mouthing ✔️
