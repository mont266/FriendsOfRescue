> Our Obi has finally been adopted 🤗


Obi was a typical 1 year old lab mix pup. Playful, goofy, happy, friendly, and he was brimming with more intelligence than he knew what to do with 🐶


Fast forward a few months, and after some work and training he is just such a well rounded boy, and happier than ever. We are so proud of him, and to top it off he has found himself his perfect home 🏡


Obi now lives with his new dad, and has settled extremely well. He has landed on all four paws in a stable and experienced home and we couldn’t be happier for him. Sometimes some of our animals take a little longer to complete their rescue journey, but this is an example of how its worth the wait 💙

### 
**All the best beautiful boy in your new forever. The pleasure was all ours ❤️**
