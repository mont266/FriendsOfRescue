Why has no one snapped this boy up 🥺


Obi is very much a typical 1 year old lab mix pup 🐶 


Playful and a little goofy. He's a very happy, friendly boy who absolutely loves all people and all dogs ☺️


He loves a run about but equally loves to curl up on the sofa for cuddles with his foster humans. He's an extremely lovable wee guy….a good spooning would be up there with his favourite  things 😄


Obi would prefer another playful dog in the home and he could live with older or dog savvy kids only due to him play mouthing ✔️ 


Please get in touch if you can offer Obi his forever home 🏡
