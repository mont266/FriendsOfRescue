> *We could count on just two hands how many returns we have had with our animals, and we pride ourselves in choosing the perfect home and fit for our babies, but sometimes it just isn‚Äôt to be üíî*

Obi was rehomed only a short 4 months ago as a 6 month old baby and has now been returned due to a change in working hours, and also some behaviour issues, although we have yet to see these in foster. The family feel they maybe need a smaller dog so he has been returned to our care and we are so glad.
Obi was and still is a sweetheart, he is still not even a year old so we are awfully sad for him but spirits haven‚Äôt been dampened too much as he is happy and his foster family just love him ‚ù§Ô∏è

This wee man is an easy going wee fella who just wants love and affection. He adores a good carry on, and he doesn‚Äôt like being left on his own so we will be looking for a home with someone at home a lot of the day ‚úîÔ∏è

Obi was rehomed with puppy/training classes that weren‚Äôt attended so we will be supplying those with his new home and anyone who does adopt him will need to expect that he needs time to learn adapt. Patience is important when adding any new animal.


We would just like to clarify that rescue isn‚Äôt a try before you buy. We do lots of checks prior to animals leaving our care, and each one is completed by a separate person to get a number of different opinions. But sadly sometimes it doesnt pan out as expected and it can get extremely deflating when this happens. However we fully believe that there are just some things we can‚Äôt control and we just have to accept that. 


**The main thing is obi is back and he will get all he needs ‚ù§Ô∏è**
