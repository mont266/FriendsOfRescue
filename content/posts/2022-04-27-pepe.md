> *This handsome young man is Pepe. At under a year old this lab mix is looking for a forever home to call his own ❤️*

Pepe arrived with us in horrendous state, emaciated with lots of cuts and sores all over his wee body (see below). Thankfully this hasn’t dampened his beautiful nature 😊

This absolute character is an active man and enjoys the great outdoors so will need a family who can match his energy levels. In saying that he still enjoys a bit of snuggle time and is an affectionate boy 🤗 


Were looking for a home with older kids (12+) as he's a bit of a whirlwind and doesn't realise the size of himself when the craic is good. He also enjoys the company of other dogs so could happily live with a wee doggy friend 🐶 


**If you could offer Pepe the home he's looking for, please get in touch for an application 🏠**
