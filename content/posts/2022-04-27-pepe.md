> *This handsome young man is Pepe. At under a year old this lab/staffy mix is looking for a forever home to call his own ❤️*

Pepe has had quite a journey so far in his short life. Pepe arrived with us in horrendous state, emaciated with lots of cuts and sores all over his wee body (see below). Thankfully this hasn’t dampened his beautiful nature 😊

This absolute character is an active man and enjoys the great outdoors so will need a family who can match his energy levels. In saying that he still enjoys a bit of snuggle time and is an affectionate boy 🤗 

Were looking for a home with older kids (12+) as he's a bit of a whirlwind and doesn't realise the size of himself when the craic is good. He also enjoys the company of other dogs so could happily live with a wee doggy friend 🐶 

**If you could offer Pepe the home he's looking for, please get in touch for an application 🏠**
