> *Everyone meet Peggy, she is a 6/7 year old pug who found herself in a pound. And we can’t even imagine how this wee dote feels everyday* 🥺

Can everyone imagine that feeling when you choke and you can’t breathe, the gasp for air and the panic that sets it until you get you breath…..imagine not getting your breathe and living with that feeling everyday 😡 

Peggy is just a wee angel and today we had her in for her MOT and unsurprisingly our vets feel she is one of the worst type of brachycephalic breed they have seen. She has an ear infection, a skin infection and her nostrils are severely infected. Her mouth is just a mess, she has gum disease and some awfully infected teeth. So tomorrow Peggy will undergo surgery for a ear flush, a dental and her nostrils widened to give her some relief for now. She may need a referral but some instant relief, even if it’s small, will help 🙏🏻

Myself personally, I find these breeds, especially in bad cases like this, very distressing to listen too and watch. I struggle to be in their company as I find it’s so hard to witness their constant strain. This is just the epitome of overbreeding for aesthetics. Peggy has a scar on her tummy which we wouldn’t imagine is a spay wound, more likely a section scar and now she is no longer useful 💔

**Peggy’s treatment is going to cost an arm and a leg and we really need your help. As always, if you can help please contact our vets Vets4Pets Crescent Link in person or via phone or click our PayPal link below** ⬇️
