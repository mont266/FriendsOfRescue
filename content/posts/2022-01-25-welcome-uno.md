> *Introducing the second part of our breeding pair….
> Our beautiful boy who is just so down and sore. He has lived his whole life with a undesecnded testicle which can be felt in his stomach. Surgery will definitely be more complicated not only because of his breed but because it will be two openings 😥*

💙💙 UNO UPDATE 💙💙


Our wee Uno is doing so well, he would sleep on a bed of nails that boy 🤣
Uno’s skin is still very sore and raw but that will take some time so we will just continue to work on that along with all his wee sores ✔️ 
We are so happy that this boys previous life is now a distant memory. He and Daphne did not deserve it 🥺
We will keep you all up to date on his progress ❤️

Again much like Daphne his skin is raw, green, scabby and smelly. He also has inter digital cysts and the skin on his feet and inbetween every toe there is large abscesses probably from lying in his own pee and faeces. They ooze a really smelly infected gunk any time he moves making it very sore for him to place his foot on the ground 😔

Seriously, what the hell?! These dogs have made their ‘keepers’ thousands of pounds a year by breeding pups that people buy because their cute or desirable or trendy. Not only do these pups come with bucket loads of their own health problems, but this is the state of their parents….how would you feel if this was a person❓

We can’t even begin to imagine being in that sort of pain, sore, cold, and having babies that are being taken from you. We can’t imagine not being able to speak, and if you could there would be no one listening. They have no way of asking for help. It’s soul destroying 💔

Well there will be no more hell for these two. They are both free of that life and we are starting the healing process both internally and externally ✔️ 
So we have decided this boy and his one descended testicle is now called ‘Uno’ 😍 

**You are so very welcome Uno ❤️**
