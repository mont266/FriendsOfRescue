> *Our handsome British bulldog Uno is now finally ready for his new home 🏠*

Uno came into our care with Daphne and both have thrived since being separated and their rehabilitation began ✔️


After many issues with his skin from years of neglect he is now ready to join a new family who will love him just as much as his fosters do. Uno adores his hooman foster siblings, he is so gentle and loving 🥰

Uno could live with another dog pending a successful meet and greet but could also live as an only dog aslong as he has company through the day. Uno isn’t a very active boy so he is looking for a life in the slow lane, and ideally someone with knowledge of the breed 🐶


With his skin condition Uno will require long term medication called apoquel to keep it under control and allow him to live without discomfort or itching ✔️
Could Uno be your new sofa buddy?
