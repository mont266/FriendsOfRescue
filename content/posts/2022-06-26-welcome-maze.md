> Maze our little JRT pup has been adopted 🤗


Maze was surrendered to a local vets with a badly broken leg. The leg had to be removed but now she's a perfectly happy and healthy little girl who is loving her new beginning 💗


Maze now lives with her new Mum and Dad and fur sister Jazz. She is so well adapted and she's just a typical wee playful and lovable pup who has more toys than she knows what to do with 🧸


**Best of luck little tripawd lady in your new forever home 🏡**
