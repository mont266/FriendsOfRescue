> *This little 12 week old baby was surrendered to a local vet on Monday after an accident causing her front leg to shatter. The vet contacted us to help and we collected her first thing 💔*

The leg was in pieces and after weighing up all the pros and cons we decided the best option for this wee pet taking into consideration length of recovery, chances of successful recovery and potential problems later with age, was to amputate.

Due to her young age she will adapt just fine and is already in much less pain post surgery than she was before, so we are hoping it’s onwards and upwards from here 🙏🏻
