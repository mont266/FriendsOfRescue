> This pretty boy is Finn and he is a 2 and a half year old Saluki 🥰

Finn was a little confused when he first arrived but he is a chilled out, easy going guy and has settled well 💙

Finn has a few resource guarding issues which we will assess while he’s in foster. He is already neutered, but will get a health check with our vets and be available for rehoming once his assessment period is complete ✔️

Welcome to the FOR family Finn ❤️
