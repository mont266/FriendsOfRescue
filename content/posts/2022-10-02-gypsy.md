**The stunning wee calico kitty is Gypsy. Only still a baby herself, she was surrendered, after recently having kittens, with last remaining baby - our wee Leo ❤️**

She is quite thin from constantly feeding litter after litter of kittens. But no more babies for this wee woman, she has now been spayed and has made herself very comfy in her foster home while she recovers 😊

She is a friendly wee dote who is loving pets and playtime, and just absolutely gorgeous 😍

**Welcome to the family Gypsy ❤️**
