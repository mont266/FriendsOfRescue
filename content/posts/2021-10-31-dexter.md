Dexter’s family love him very much but unfortunately Dexter is blind and due to concerns for his own safety he had to be relocated and thankfully his family chose to come to us. We have assured them he will get only the best ☺️

Dexter is a big boy, he is 9kg and completely blind. He also gets very stressed, very easily and this normally targets his bladder and he becomes blocked BUT once this settles and it has gone he is a sweetheart…..a giant purr machine 🐱

Even though Dexter just arrived a week ago we are starting our search for his new family straight away a we don’t want to let him settle to much in foster as he will get stressed again when he leaves. Dexter’s needs ⬇️

• Indoor home (due to sight issues)

• Lots of company

• Ideally pet free

• Understanding

• Likes ‘fatcats’ 😉

Please get in touch if you can offer Dexter a new home 🏠
