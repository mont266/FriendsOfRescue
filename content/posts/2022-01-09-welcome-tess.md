> *Our Little Tess has been adopted 🤗*

Before she came to us, all Tess ever knew was life with her and her dad. So when her dad passed away she was incredibly grief stricken and stressed 💔


Once she came round and settled in foster we met the lovliest little lady who just adored human company, her grub and snoozes 😴


Tess now has a new dad, and they are instantly the best of friends. She was a little unsettled to begin with as expected but overall she has just been a wee delight. Shes loving pottering about the garden with her dad and getting tucked in for her wee naps 🤗


**Best of luck little lady with your new best friend in your new home 🏡**
