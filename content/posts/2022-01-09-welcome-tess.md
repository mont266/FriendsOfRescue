Tess, our wee golden oldie has been adopted 🤗


Tess was sadly returned to us when her daddy took extremely unwell, she is just a sweet wee gal who adores her humans, so our heart absolutely broke for her 💔


But she is a strong lady and settled well into foster, and has now settled amazingly well into her new home and routine with her new mum 🏡


She has taken it all in her stride and is loving her walks to the beach, the forest and round the village where she is an absolute hit with the locals. Her mum sent us this wee video collage of her time with her so far and it just filled us with joy!

**All the best wee lady, you deserve the world ❤️**
