> *Our beautiful lady Tess is on the hunt for her forever home 🏡* 

Tess came to us about 4 months ago in very sad circumstances after her owner passed away. She is 11 years old and was incredibly stressed having lost everything she had ever known. And she was in such a bad way she needed sedation to travel to us. Thankfully after a few days in foster she started to come round and they learnt she is the lovliest little lady who adores snacks and human company. Tess went on to be rehomed and unfortunately her new dad has taken ill suddenly. He is unable to care for her so Tess is back with us, however she is a very different wee dog this time thanks to lots of love and care ❤️

Tess is the easiest dog. She enjoys her walks but lives her naps and spends most of her day snoozing beside her foster mum while she works from home. She is a really confident wee girl, who is happy to just be with you. All she wants is your time 🥰

Tess seeking a quiet home where she will be the only pet and her human is home alongside her for most of the day. Due to Tess quiet nature she would prefer a doggy free home ✔️ 

**Please get in touch if you would like to give Tess a spot on your sofa for the rest of her days 🏡**
