Lola has been super in foster and we now know what kind of home would suit her best 😉

Lola is most definitely a lap dog….zero concept of personal space. Sometimes she likes to replicate a scarf or maybe even sometimes a hot water bottle, just depends on how long you sit still 😆

Lola is in foster with both kids and 2 male dogs and she isn’t bothered about either. She doesn’t necessarily need to be rehomed with other dogs but will need some some form of company as she doesn’t like being left alone, so no long working hours. Lola doesn’t like female pooches ✔️

**Please get in touch if you can offer Lola her forever home 🏡**
