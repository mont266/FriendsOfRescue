Yesterday we received a call from someone saying they had found a pup in awful condition, dumped in the middle of nowhere. He was emaciated, filthy, and just a sad, sorry looking sight. He was a lost soul looking for someone to help him 😞

So of course we had him taken straight to our vets. Upon arrival both ourselves and our vets were in shock. It’s not often our vets use the word ‘skeletal’ so that gives you some indication of just how thin and malnourished this poor boy is. What appeared to be a 4-5 month old pup is actually a 2-4 year old adult with a full set of well used adult teeth.
He weighs the same as a pup of 4-5 months, his head and body have all fallen in because of lack of muscle mass due to his poor diet. His ears and face have next to no hair on them at all. He had maggots, lice and fleas all over his his wee body. So first things first was to get rid of that coat, he had to be sedated as the coat was so heavy. It had been dragging his skin and causing it to break and bruise 🥺


Once shaved, his poor wee body told the story of how he had been living and it's soul destroying. Such a sweet gentle boy and so trusting, it’s heartbreaking. He was just waiting on the right person and we are so glad someone cared enough to stop by him 🙏🏻

This little man has been named Mango by our vets, as that was the fragrance of nice shampoo they used to wash that old life away.
