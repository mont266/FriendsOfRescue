When Mango was found he was so emaciated, in such a poor physical and mental state we just didn’t see how we were gonna get him to this point but with the help of his amazing foster family here we are ❤️

Something a little different for his appeal, written by his fosters. The people that know him best 👇🏻 


Everyone needs a Mango in their life at some point....forgiving, gentle, loves connection and a good belly rub...he's good for the soul 🥰 Mango has come a long way! He loves children and other dogs. I cant imagine him ever being cross. He cries after other dogs when out a walk....especially if their kind to him and up for a play about. He's never been around cats so unsure about this. In true Collie style he's fun and energetic, loves his squeaky ball. He'll even play away by himself in the garden with it. He's content on his own but prefers company. Despite being full of energy, he loves cuddles at night and winding down with his humans. Mango sleeps all night and is fully house trained, loves his home comforts, and is definitely not a street dog anymore 🙌🙌 despite how far he has come he still needs support and someone with patience to understand his journey. He's comfortable with most house noises now but can still be very easily freaked and needs a lot of reassurance at times.  Mango can be very puppy like and still needs more training. He's bouncy, daft as a brush, so playful, and extremely affectionate, would let you pet him all day, and is basically a big ball of fluff (after a bath). You just canny help but fall in love with this wee man 🥰

Now with the boring but essential stuff. His foster said that if Mango is being walked he needs to be kept on the lead. His collie instinct is strong and he does try to run after cars so will need some time and training with this. This does make it more challenging when out walks!! He also loves a good wee chew ....like all dogs if they get bored!! We would love to find him a home with another gentle dog, he really loves them (although with human company at home this isn’t essential) ✔️
