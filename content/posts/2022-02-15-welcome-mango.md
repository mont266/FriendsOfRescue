> *Every so often we get an animal in that shocks us to the core….and Mango was one of them and we can now share that he is happily adopted ❤️*

Mango has been adopted by the amazing family that also adopted Jilly a few months ago 🐶


Both of these collies have been absolutely failed by human kind. Both emaciated, neglected…Jilly even having some kind of burns 💔


Both of these dogs are now doing amazing and their family are just so committed to their lives and it’s amazing for us to see after watching how far they have come already ☺️


This is what it’s all about and the reason this has happened is because of your support, our amazing fosters and adoptee families. It’s very much a team effort and the results are astounding ❤️


**Best of luck Mango (now Jack) and our beautiful Jilly ❤️**
