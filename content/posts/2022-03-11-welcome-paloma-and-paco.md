Our little chihuahua pair are now ready for rehoming 🥰


Paloma and Paco are approx 2 years old and were surrendered to us when Paloma was days away from giving birth. Paloma went on to raise 4 beautiful babies who were rehomed a few weeks ago and now it’s mummy and daddy’s turn ❤️


These 2 are a bonded pair so we wouldn’t dream of separating them so they are looking for their new home together. What they need ⬇️ 


• a quiet home with plenty of attention

• they can live with other dogs or would be fine just the 2 of them

• kids 12+


Paloma and Paco are in foster in Newtownabbey, please read their requirements for suitability before messaging.


**Please get in touch if you would like to offer these pair a home 🏠**
