‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è DOUBLE ADOPTION NEWS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Our little mummy and daddy pair have had quite the journey with us‚Ä¶.
Both arriving as an unwanted pair and Paloma heavily pregnant. They raised their 5 babies and did an excellent job.

So many animals came and went while this pair sat and sat. Rehoming pairs can be more difficult but we knew as a bonded pair they were staying together regardless of how long it took üòä

Then just like that their wait was worth it. Their new family just adore them and the feeling is mutual as you can see ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Best of luck you beautiful little pair, it was a pleasure** ü•∞
