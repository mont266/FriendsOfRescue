They were surrendered to us today due to a change in family circumstances, but thankfully they chose rescue 🙏🏼


On arrival they didn’t have collars or leads so foster took them into pets at home for some essentials and even managed to get their nails cut too. They were trimmed by the lovely Laura in The Groom Room, Abbeycentre who so kindly did just before closing and free of charge 😇


Understandably they are nervous, but doing so well considering. They will both get their MOTs in the coming days as we fear Paloma might be pregnant, but we will keep you all updated on their journey with us ❤️


**Please do not enquire as these two beauties are NOT available yet
But for now, welcome to the family Paco and Paloma ❤️**
