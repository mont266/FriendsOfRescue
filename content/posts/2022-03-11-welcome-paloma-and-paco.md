*D﻿OUBLE ADOPTION NEWS!*

*O﻿ur little Mummy and Daddy pair have hadquite the journey with us...*

*A﻿rriving as an unwanted pair, and Paloma heavily pregnant. They did an excellent job rasising their 5 babies and finally have found their own happiness together.* 

*S﻿o many animals came and went while this pair sat and sat. Rehoming pairs can be more difficult but we knew as a bonded pair they were staying together regardless of how long it took!*

*T﻿hen just like that their wait was worth it. Their new family just adore them and the feeling is as mutual as you can see. Best of luck you beautiful little pair, it was a pleaseure.*
