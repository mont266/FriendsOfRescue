> *\*This little sweetheart is Bella and she is a 1 year old JRT 😍Little Bella our JRT pup has been adopted ☺️*


Bella was an unclaimed stray and came to us and immediately settled in well with her foster parents. She was a just a young and playful little girl who just wanted to be loved 🥰


Bella now lives with her mum and furry brother Barney. The two of them haven’t stopped playing since Bella arrived and they truly are the best of friends. We are just so glad they found each other ❤️


**All the best little Bella in your perfect forever home 🏡**
