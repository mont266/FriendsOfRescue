Bella is the cutest wee angel, she will belly crawl up to you looking for kisses and hugs. Just a real loving little nugget that you want to snuggle forever 🤗 

Bella has had all her outstanding medical work done and she is foster recovering from her spay surgery. She has a slight skin irritation that is also being treated. During her MOT it was established Bella has two grade 4 slipping patellae, this is very common in the breed but only something we will be able determine what to do with on foster assessment. She is only 7kg which isn’t a big weight so we are hoping it will be a management issues as she gets older as opposed to surgery 🙏🏻
