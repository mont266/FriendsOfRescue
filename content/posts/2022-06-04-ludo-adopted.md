> Our handsome tabby man Ludo has been adopted 🤗

Ludo came to us after he was found as a stray. He was then neutered and went to foster where it became clear he was a man that enjoyed his comforts. In fact he made himself so comfortable he isn’t leaving 🏡

Ludo, now called Loki, lives with former FOR GSD gal Freya along with two other canine siblings Jackson and Riley, and his new feline sister Nibs. Since he fit in so well, we asked his new mum if she thought about adopting him, and well it was a bit silly of us to ask in hindsight as he was already sleeping inbetween his mum and dad. The man was going nowhere ❤️

**All the best big chap, were so happy for you** 💙
