🧡🧡 LEO'S APPEAL 🧡🧡


Our little Leo is now seeking his new home 🏡


He will be signed off from our vets on friday after his little head wobble ✔️ 


Leo is the perfect mix of cute and cheeky 😸


• Leo has started his vaccines ✅️


• He loves to snuggle up with the resident cats so another cat is essential 🐈


• Leo can live with cat friendly dogs and cat savvy children 👦🏻 


Leo is still a baby so he is still learning how to perfect his pounce, how his claws work and all about heights, he also loves snuggling up on the bed at night time after his 15mins of zoomies 🐱
