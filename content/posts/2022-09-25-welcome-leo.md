🧡🧡 WELCOME LEO 🧡🧡

This little cutie is Leo and he is our first male calico 🥰

Leo was surrendered earlier in the week along with his mummy. 

Some of you may recognise him from our post the other day after he was admitted into the vets. We are pleased to let you know he is doing well and has been allowed home, he is on a course of antibiotics and is bursting with kitten energy 🧶
