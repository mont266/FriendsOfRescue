**This wee pint sized Pom is Rocco and he is 8 years old 😍**


Rocco has joined us in sad circumstances after his mum has passed away 💔
Rocco has been a very well cared for wee dote and you can tell because he is a little sassy man. He was barging around in the vets before he was collected by his foster 😆

He has settled into foster very well and just enjoying all the attention and company ❤️


**Rocco will be available for rehoming when his assessment period is over ✔️**

Welcome to family Rocco ❤️
