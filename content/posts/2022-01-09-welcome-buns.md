2 of then are a male pair called Blue and Benjamin that were kept in a very small space and started to fight. So they are now in separate foster care and their wounds can start healing. Benjamin has already been neutered. He is much more confident than Blue so he is getting a little time to settle in before his surgery ❤️‍🩹

We also have Elsa who was bought for breeding purposes. But she didn’t like the male buns (can’t say we blame her) so she has now been spayed and is settling in well with her experienced bunny foster 🐰

All bunnies will be available for rehoming separately once their medical work and assessment period is complete ✔️
