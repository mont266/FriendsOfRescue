Jilly arrived with us with missing hair and burns all over her body (see pictures below). She was just a bag of bones too but her wee shut down soul was definitely going to be the biggest challenge. But with the help of her amazing, dedicated and loving fosters we have got there 😊

Jilly loves nothing more but to just relax on the sofa, she is so easy going its unbelievable. She loves company, lots of hugs and cuddles, and just loves getting attention from everybody. She likes to go with her foster everywhere, walking along side her and loves car trips. Her foster said she is just the dream dog and the easiest shes ever had to deal with, and whoever ends up with jilly will be so lucky 🥰
