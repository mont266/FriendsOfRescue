> *We are so delighted that our sweet little Jilly has found her forever home 🤗*

Jilly came to us with covered in burns and bald patches. She was emaciated, shut down and terrified. She had never known a gentle hand, but once she realised she was safe and loved, she became what was described by her foster as the perfect dog. Loyal, gentle and oh so affectionate. 🐶

Jilly’s new family are a great example of the patience it sometimes requires to rescue. With young children they do not suit every dog, but they were understanding and knew that the right rescue was out there for them somewhere, and they where willing to wait to find them. And we are so glad it was Jilly they found ❤️


Jilly has settled great with her new mum and dad, her hooman brother and sister and her furry brother Bruce. The perfect family for the perfect girl.

**We don’t need to wish her much luck, but Jilly it was an absolute pleasure to help you on your way to the life youve always deserved 💕**
