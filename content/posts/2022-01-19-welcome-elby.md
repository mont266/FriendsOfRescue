> *This guy is Elby, he is a 1 year old merle collie and sadly he is completely deaf with only partial vision🐶*

Elby was being rehomed privately because he was struggling to live with the other dogs in his home. He is terrified of them and because of his disadvantages he feels the need to be defensive. It was not fair on him to live that way in a constant state of stress so thankfully they agreed to send him to rescue to be sure he finds his perfect home 🏡

Elby has settled well into foster and is thriving in the peaceful atmosphere. Being deaf will not hold this boy back in the slightest. He just wants to feel safe and loved. He adores his cuddles and is showing himself to be a very affectionate and sweet boy 🤗


Elby doesn’t like being alone so he would need someone home quite a bit of the day, and no other dogs. He will thrive in an environment that will suit him 🤞🏻


Please get in touch if you can offer Elby a home 🏡
