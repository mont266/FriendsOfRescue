> *Our little zorro has been adopted 🤗*


For a puppy he had quite a long wait to find the right fit. He suffered with quite a few time wasters, but then along came his new sister Rita and her mum and dad and that was that! 
Zorro, now called Rocky, has been settling in the best. The move hasn’t took much of a wrinkle out of him and he’s spent his time playing with Rita who is teaching him how to dog. If the video is anything to go by, the two of them will become the best of friends, just perfect company for each other ❤️


**All the best for your future little man, it was absolutely our pleasure to help find you your perfect home 🏡**
