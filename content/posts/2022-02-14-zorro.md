Zorro is the loveliest little character. A bundle of love and energy and adores the company of other dogs so we feel a home with another playful dog would suit him. He can also live with dog savvy kids ✔️ 


All our puppies are rehomed with mandatory puppy classes to ensure well rounded, socialised, happy puppies 🐶 


Please do not apply if you cannot commit to owning a puppy and everything that comes with owning a dog. That also includes a settling in period and all the crazy puppyness that comes with it❗️


**Please get in touch if you can offer Zorro his forever home 🏡**
