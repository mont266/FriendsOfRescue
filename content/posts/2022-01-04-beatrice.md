She came in with an eye ulcer so she’s been getting lots of TLC from her foster family. She’s finished all her medical treatment and has bounced back wonderfully 😊


She was a shy wee thing but she’s come out of her shell. Nowadays she is very affectionate and vocal, meowing to tell you she wants pets 🤗


She just loves company so ideally her new family wouldn’t have long working hours. Of course she’s is still a kitten so can scratch unintendedly so only older or cat savvy kids ✔️


**Please get in touch if you can offer wee Beatrice her forever home 🏡**
