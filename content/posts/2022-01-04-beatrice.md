Our little Beatrice has been adopted 🤗


This pretty little lady was originally quite shy. But after some TLC from her fosters she wasn’t long in coming out of her shell. She waited a little longer for her home than we expected considering how pretty she is, but sometimes the right home is just worth the wait 🙏🏼


Beatrice now lives with her new Mum, who has said she is everything she could have wanted and more as she’s just such a character. The shy girl we once knew just doesn’t exist anymore. She sussed the place out on arrival and then just settled down as if she's lived there forever. We think she just knew she was home 🏡


We are so happy for you Beatrice, all the best in your new beginnings ❤️
