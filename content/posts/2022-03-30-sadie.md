> *Our little cavalier mix baby is still looking for her new home 🏡*

Sadie came in with her brother Charles who is now booked to his new home. They are very confident happy little puppies.  Sadie is a very sassy, little princess who also loves a good carry on. She will need to share her home with another confident dog 🐶 


Ideally Sadie would be rehomed to a home with no long working hours, and can be rehomed with kids 12+ ✔️ 


As always our puppies are rehomed with mandatory puppy classes which will ensure happy, well rounded dogs 🐶 


Sadie is in foster in Derry/Londonderry area. 


**Please get in touch to offer Sadie a new home 🏠**
