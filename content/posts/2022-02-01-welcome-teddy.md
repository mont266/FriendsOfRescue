So our little Teddy who was found in horrendous condition had major trust issues when he first arrived. He didn’t like being touched or even looked at. He was a product of his awful past. But thankfully with the help of a great foster family, time, love and the correct medical treatment, this wee man has come on leaps and bounds 🤗

He adores cuddles, fussing and now enjoys a very happy life 😁

Teddy has now been neutered and the infections have left his body. But it was such a long surgery for his neuter, we couldn’t complete his dental at the same time so that will happen next week. Unfortunately he requires a full tooth extraction so every single tooth will have to go 🥺


But he is happy, content and loved and after his dental he will be ready for his new home 🏡 


**Keep going Teddy 🧸**
