> *Our wee teddy has been adopted by none other than his fantastic foster family ❤️*

Teddy came to us in an awful state, he was emaciated, awful skin, a mouthful of rotten teeth and a body full of infections. Mentally this wee man was broken and it has taken a lot of time, patience and understanding and we think that is probably how he and his foster family fell in love with each other. A journey like that sometimes shows you something you didn’t know you were missing and that something was Teddy 😍


2 weeks ago he received his final surgery and had all his teeth taken out and now he is such a happy, care free fella with lots of character 😁


I think you will agree that when we snapped Teddy at our ‘Winter Sessions’ you can see his rescue journey is far behind him 🙌🏻


**Well done Teddy ❤️**
