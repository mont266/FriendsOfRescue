This just makes us wanna burst….Darragh has been adopted 🎈


Our gorgeous, brave puppy Darragh is thriving in his new home. He is a far cry from the baby we found on the road with over 90 pellets in his tiny malnourished body. Darragh had quite the journey with us, between surgeries, his mental and physical recoveries and his more recent love for renovating and redecorating….mainly curtains belonging to his long suffering foster mum 😆 


This boy is one of the bravest souls you could meet. His family came to visit with zero expectations, they knew he might not approach them, they also knew he might not be ok with there wee dog but they took it all in their stride and for that reason Darragh was their missing piece and he knew that too. Only a few days ago this boy completed his first 10k walk and the check in and engagement this boy had with his mum was beautiful. Constantly looking at her for reassurance and striving forward because he trusts her. This boy has landed on all 4 paws and along with his furry siblings he will live a happy and full life and it’s all we could have hoped for!
We want to thank each and everyone of you for sharing, and supporting his story far and wide. It helped us with his recovery and medical costs as well as giving the reach it had to find his amazing family 🙏🏻


And last but not least his foster family, Danielle and Andrew who took the time to work on Darragh and help him gain his trust in hoomans and to love every bit of his goofy self to get him back on his paws 🐾
