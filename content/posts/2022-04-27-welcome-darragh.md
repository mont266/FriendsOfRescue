> *Our Darragh is ready for adoption 🎉*

Darragh was found cowering at the side of the road at only 6 months old unable to move. When we got him to safety we realised he was covered in wounds but under his heavy coat it was difficult to see. We had to shave him right down and then it was discovered that Darragh had been shot 😡 

There was over 90 pellets in his body that we could clearly see in his X-ray and he has had a few surgeries since to remove the ones we could. He was like a skeleton when he arrived, weighing just 12.8kg, but now weighing a fab 24kg he is looking so well. Well enough that he has been signed off by our vet and we know he is ready for the next part of his journey ❤️

Darragh is understandably shy and very nervous on meeting new people and things but does come round with patience and understanding. He will need someone who will let him recover at his pace and work on his confidence with gentle reassurance and guidance ✔️

When he comes round he is an absolute sweetheart and an absolute eejit. Loves curling up on the sofa when he's not trying to play with a toy or lick you to get a pet 😂

Darragh’s needs ⬇️ 

• Darragh doesn’t like being alone, although crate trained he likes to know you’re there


• Darragh can live with cats


• Darragh will need a few meets with any dog in the home


• No kids under 10

Many people mistake Darragh for a Dutch shepherd because of his shorter hair, but he had been shaved and now it’s slowly growing back. Darragh is actually a Belgian shepherd so he will be long haired and super stunning 😍 

**Please get in touch if you would like to offer Darragh a home** 🏡
