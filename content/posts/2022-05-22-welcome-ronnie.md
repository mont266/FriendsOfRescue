> *This handsome Tabby man is Ronnie and he is 2 years old 😻*

Ronnie came to us following a change in his family circumstances. He has since been neutered and is recovering well in foster ✔️


He is a wee chatter box, playful, not a bit phased by the fosters dogs or his change in environment, and all round is a very sweet and affectionate wee man 💙


**Welcome to the family Ronnie ❤️**
