Ronnie came to us following a change in his family circumstances. He has since recovered from neuter and is ready to find himself a new home🏡

Ronnie is both chilled out and playful, he's really sweet and just adores human company and affection. Top that off with his beautiful green eyes, his foster has described him as the perfect cat 😻

Ronnie would make a great family pet. He can live with other cats, dogs that are used to cats, and children that are animal savvy✔️

**Please get in touch if you can offer Ronnie a forever home ❤️**
