> Our lovely tabby boy Ronnie has been adopted 🤗


Ronnie came to us initially following a change in his owners circumstances. And although a little unsure to be begin with, he settled well and has now found himself a great home🏡


Ronnie now lives with 3 furry brothers, and although his new Mum says he can be a little grumpy bum (aren't we all!) he is making himself right at home 🥰


**All the best handsome, wishing you all the best in your new home with your new banana 🤣💙**
