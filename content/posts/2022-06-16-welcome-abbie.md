> *You may remember an appeal for a foster for a GSD earlier in the week that had found herself on death row in a dog pound 🥺*

She was surrendered by her owner due to ill health and she was condemned as quite undesirable because she doesn’t like other dogs….but so what? Theres plenty of humans I don’t like either but that doesn’t mean I should lose my life 😡

Anyway this is our gal Abbie, a very happy, friendly, middle aged girl with so much life to live ❤️

Abbie is settling well into foster and will get her vet check this week and any outstanding medical work will be completed ✔️
