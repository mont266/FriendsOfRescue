💔💔 ANOTHER OLDIE OVERLOOKED 💔💔

Come on folks we have had no interest in this beautiful girl….just look at that silver face 😍

This beautiful German Shepherd is Abbie and she is approx 8 years old 😍

Abbie found herself in the pound due to her owners ill-health. Sadly Abbie was deemed “undesirable” and was due to be put to sleep just because she isn’t keen on other dogs 😡

We thought it was ridiculous, and now having assessed her in foster it's even more ridiculous, as even though she doesn't like dogs, this girl has so much to give her new family. She is intelligent, beautiful and loving ❤️

Abbie has had several lumps tested and removed which were caused by an infection and has since been treated with medication that cleared it right up making her good to go ✔️

Abbie is a happy and friendly girl who loves humans, but she is seeking a home where she is the only pet. She is also pretty agile for an older lady so your garden must be secure. She is suitable to live with children 12+ who are dog savvy, as although she is gentle, she is pretty big and jumps up for cuddles 🤗

**Please get in touch if you can offer this beautiful girl her forever home 🏡**
