Polly arrived with us with a bad skin condition that just got out of hand and difficult to keep at bay but finally we have it under control and she is now ready to be spayed ✔️


Polly is a really affectionate girl who just adores people. Polly gets on ok with other dogs but just steam rolls them with play, so we feel a home of her own would suit better 🐶


Polly is a great example of the lab breed and we just love the bones of her and she so deserves this new start ❤️


**Please get in touch if you can offer Polly her new home 🏡**
