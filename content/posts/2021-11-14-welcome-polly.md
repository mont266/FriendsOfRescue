> *Finally our beautiful Polly has been adopted and her wait has been so worth it ❤️*


After months of hard work and dedication from her foster mum, Polly was signed off and her search for a forever home started. Her monthly medication costs really put people off….but not her new mummy ❤️


Having really wanted a lab type doggy for a long time, she waited until she was in the perfect place and then along came Polly 😆


She is settling in so well, loving her walks and generally living her best life with her fabulous shiny healthy coat 🖤


**Best of luck gorgeous girl, you so deserve it! ❤️**
