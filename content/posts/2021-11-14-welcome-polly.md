This beautiful lab lady is Polly and she is 4 years old 🐶

Polly was surrendered to us for a number of reasons but struggling to get on top of her skin condition was one of them and sometimes admitting that they need more is the hardest part so please be kind in your comments.

Polly is a dream gal….big, strong and think she is the size of a budgie 😆

This gal will need lots of ongoing treatment, including daily baths but she is already responding well to her treatment and her dedicated foster team have been amazing. We are so lucky to have them 🙏🏻

Welcome to the family Polly ❤️
