> This pretty girl is Anna and she is a 2 year old lab.

Unfortunately this girl was surrendered with very sore skin and awful bad infected ears. She is now on meds, and skin treatment so we can clear this up before she is spayed and vaccinated 😄

This girl is a wee dote. Dinky (but strong) girl who would fit in to any household. She could live with dog savvy kids and other dogs ✔️ 

Welcome Anna ❤️
