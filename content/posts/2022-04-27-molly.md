Molly our little lab cross pup has been adopted 🤗


Before arriving with us Molly was passed from pillar to post between people who liked the idea of having a puppy, but weren't willing to give one the patience and training they need 🙄


Thankfully we’ve managed to break that cycle and found her perfect family. She now lives with her new fur sister Bailey and has been settling in great to her new home 🏡


Molly is typically playful for a pup, but she has been doing great with her commands and made great progress with her separation anxiety thanks to a settled routine and consistency with her new family. But of course she still manages to roll about the sofa and whizz about the garden with toys twice her size 😆


All the best for your future little one, were so happy you can finally settle ❤️
