Unfortunately a while ago Jasmine was attacked by another dog and she was quite literally ripped apart. She survived the awful ordeal but is riddled with anxiety since, which is completely understandable. Her family tried really hard to work with it but with their working hours and Jasmine spending more time alone, she just wasn’t happy. So now we can find her the perfect companion who can be with her all the time 🤞🏻


Jasmine will be spayed this week and any outstanding medical work done ✔️ 


She has been settling in well to foster and is such a wee affectionate pet who loves a cuddle on the sofa 🤗 


Jasmine will be available for rehoming next week when her assessment period is over (so please don’t ask if she is suitable with kids etc….we don’t know yet) 🐶 


**Welcome to the family Jasmine ❤️**
