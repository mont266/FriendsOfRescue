> *Jasmine our little Yorkie lady has been adopted 🤗*


Sadly before Jasmine came into our care she suffered quite a severe attack by another dog. This left her with crippling anxiety and distrust of the unknown 💔


Thankfully, she settled very well in foster, as the only dog, a good routine and loads of love in snuggles she has blossomed and grew so much in confidence with her new family 🌸


**Best of luck little woman in your new forever home 🏡**
