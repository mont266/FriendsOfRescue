> *This poor little soul was found in the middle of nowhere presumably dumped, matted, smelly (covered in faeces) and absolutely terrified* 💔

It took a while to catch her but the guys in the area persevered and got her to safety and we got her from there. She was climbing the walls when you went near her. Trying not make eye contact….trying her best to make herself invisible. It is extremely upsetting and she is only a baby 🥺

She is now in foster after being washed and looked over by the vet and she can recover at her own pace. We hope she starts to understand we are only here to help bless her ❤️
