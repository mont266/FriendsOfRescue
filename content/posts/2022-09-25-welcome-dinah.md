**💜💜 WELCOME DINAH 💜💜**

This wee beauty is 13 weeks old and bought as a British short haired a few weeks ago. Unfortunately due to allergies she is now in rescue.

Her name is Dinah and she is a love bug, she also knows how pretty she is 😆Dinah would benefit from a home with other feline company. She could also live with a cat friendly dog if introduced properly ✔️ 

**Welcome to the family Dinah ❤️**
