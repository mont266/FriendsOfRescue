Callie is the sweetest little girl, very friendly and playful and it was always a matter of who was going to be lucky enough to have her brighten up their home 🏡


She has settled brilliantly with her new family. She has two new hooman siblings who adore her and one furry brother called Smoosh who is as much a wee ball of fun as Callie is. They have not stopped playing since, so much so, her mum sent us this video and asked where she can take the batteries out 😆

**Wishing you as many garden zoomies as your heart desires in your new forever home Callie. So happy for you ❤️**
