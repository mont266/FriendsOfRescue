> *This little dote is Callie and she is a 7 month old Bichon mix 🥰*

Unfortunately Callie was surrendered to us due to severe allergies in the family and thankfully they chose rescue 🙏🏻

Callie is a super friendly, affectionate little pup and will be a fantastic addition to a family 🤗

Callie was spayed last week and with all her medical work completed she has been settling well into foster 🐶 


This wee dote would really benefit from doggy company. She loves people so she can live with dog savvy kids. Overall she is just a wee sweetheart and whoever adopts her will be extremely lucky 🍀 


**Please get in touch if you would like to offer Callie a new home 🏡**
