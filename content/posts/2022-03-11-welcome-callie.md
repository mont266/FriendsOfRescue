Unfortunately Callie was surrendered to us due to severe allergies in the family and thankfully they chose rescue 🙏🏻


Callie is a super friendly, affectionate little pup and will be a fantastic addition to a family 🤗

This little one will be spayed and any outstanding medical work carried out tomorrow and will settle in foster for her assessment period ✔️ 


**Welcome Callie ❤️**
