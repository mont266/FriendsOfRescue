‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è ADOPTION NEWS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è


A few months ago we got 3 little furries surrendered to us after living their life in a yard. Two of these babies were Kenny and Hallie üê∂


Both of these littluns were rehomed, separately, to amazing homes and are both doing brilliantly. Their outside lives are well and truly behind them ‚ù§Ô∏è


The third little one was our Suzie who we sadly lost last month, she may not be with us but she will never be forgotten üåà 


Enjoy your beautiful little lives Kenny and Hallie ‚ù§Ô∏è
