>  *Our big lump of love Koda has been adopted 🤗*

Koda is the lovliest natured girl, shes just so sweet and is a great example of a bully type breed which are so often misunderstood by people. Thankfully her new mum is not one of those people ❤️


She knew right away Koda was her girl and happily made an 8hr round trip to meet her. It was love at first sight all round and Koda now lives with her new human siblings who adore her, and her JRT sister called Shortie 🐶


Koda has settled in so well its like shes always been there and she is loving life. She has since been out chatting to cows on her walks, become a bit of a sun worshipper and of course absolutely snoring the house down 😆

**We are so happy for you and your new family Koda. Wishing you all the sun snoozes and snores you can muster in your perfect home 🏡**
