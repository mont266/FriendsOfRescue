🧡🧡 SKYE’S APPEAL 🧡🧡

**This is mummy doodle Skye. She's just 14 months old but unfortunately has already had a litter of 10 pups 💔**

Since giving birth to her pups she became intolerant of the young children in the home, and they became scared to use their back garden. Thankfully she came to us with her remaining 2 babies (you might have saw their welcome post earlier this week, Genie & Pepper) 🐶

She's settling well into foster, and in true doodle style she is a bit nutty. She hasn’t had an ounce of training so will need a new family dedicated to that and teaching her how to adjust to living indoors as her foster family have been committed to, so this needs continued on with. Skye needs a stable home with lots of love, and she can live with kids over 14 and medium/large breed dogs based on a successful meet and greet but she’d also be happy as an only pet 🐶 


Please read Skye’s requirements and get in touch if you meet them all ✔️
