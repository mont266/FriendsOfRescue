> This little rocket is Saffy and she is a 20 week springer spaniel 😍

Saffy arrived to us under very sad circumstances beyond her family's control so we need understanding from our supporters.

Saffy is a typical Springer gal. Nuts, affectionate, beautiful and my goodness is this girl part fish….she loves water 💦 

She will make an amazing family member for whoever is lucky enough to adopt her 🐶 

Welcome Saffy ❤️
