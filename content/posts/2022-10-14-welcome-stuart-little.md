So in the last few days we have taken in another 4 animals and this is one of them…and we are so angry and upset 😠 


**Not even 8 weeks old**, found in a bucket with wire on the top being kicked around with 2 cigarette burns on his head, skin and bone and just a broken wee soul 😡

As if that wasn’t bad enough this wee man was parvo tested today and albeit negative he has tested positive for giardia (a parasite of the bowel) and his wee frail, thin body is just about fighting it bless him 😞

He is the sweetest wee soul and we are so glad he is with us. He is now on fluids in our vets getting medication for giardia and some good food, little and often to build him up 🙏🏻


**We would like to thank you to each and every person who was involved in his rescue, you saved his life.** 


This little dude won't be ready for rehoming until after we've got his condition under control. We would like to introduce you all to ‘Stuart Little’ ❤️
