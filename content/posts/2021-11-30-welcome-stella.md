😞😞😞😞😞😞😞

We feel like we are saying this a lot lately but what the hell is going on…..
Everyone meet Stella, the trophy breed for every cool, trendy person walking the planet and the most popular breed of 2020. The Frenchie.

Stella has probably supplied many a birthday present or Christmas present for people over the year while she herself is a welfare case. She looks well doesn’t she❓She is the perfect advertisement for people buying from breeders for their cute puppies…..

Her skin is raw, it’s actually falling off. She smells of disease and rotting flesh. We don’t know much of her previous life nor do we care to know because what is left of her skeletal body tells us enough.

Stella has a lot mental scarring too. She is suspicious as you would expect. She can’t concentrate on more than one thing a time and likes one on one time more than a lot going on at once. She doesn’t care for dogs much either…not surprising if the only time she met another canine was to be served so again we can’t blame her.

We can only promise Stella that we will try our best to fix things for her as best we can. She is a beautiful little dog and she hasn’t deserved whatever has happened to her. We will do our best for you little squish ❤️

Welcome to family Stella 🥰
