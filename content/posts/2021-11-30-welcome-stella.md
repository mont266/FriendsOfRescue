> ***Our sassy Stella has finally been adopted and after all this time it was only ever gonna be by her foster mumma ❤️***

Stella arrived with us as snapping Frenchie who liked nobody, trusted nobody and was a site for sore eyes with a past of complete neglect.
Thankfully she completely bonded with her foster mum and trusts anyone she does (except vets 😆) they are quite literally a match made in heaven 🥰


So after almost 5 months of recovery and treatment Stella was signed off and adopted and we are so chuffed for her and her mummy Kathy ❤️


Her mum adores the bones off her….even her constant snoring like a big piggie 🐷 


**Have the best life Stella ❤️**
