> *Our little kitten Sweetpea has been adopted 🤗*

Sweetpea came to us after she was found, as a tiny little kitten straying alone and afraid, by somebody out walking their dogs. Thankfully they took her to safety and she has simply thrived ever since 🙏🏼

In foster Sweetpea met her brother, former FOR man Magic (now called Flearoy). We couldn't get enough of the little and large pictures so we're now delighted that she has been officially adopted and there will be plenty more where they came from 🐈‍⬛

**Best of luck little Sweetpea in your amazing new forever home, you so deserve it 🏡**
