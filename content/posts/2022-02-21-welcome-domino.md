‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è SPECIAL ADOPTION NEWS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è


Domino had been fostered by our "Granny Jojo" and we're excited to tell you that he won't be moving again because he has absolutely melted the hearts of his foster mum and dad ‚ù§Ô∏è


They have now called him Monty and this is what his new "Mummy Jojo" said, "He's a big lick, he greets me every morning, he is so affectionate and loves his cuddles, we couldn't be without him now!" ü§ó 


It's hard to put our finger on why but this wee man is such a special soul. He is the sweetest boy! And we are just over the moon that he has found a special forever home üè° 


Good luck Monty, we love you ‚ù§Ô∏è
