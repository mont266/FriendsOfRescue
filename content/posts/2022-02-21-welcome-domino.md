> *This lovely boy is Domino and he is approx 4 years old*

Like our boy Marmalade, he has come to us after being a TNR that was simply too friendly to not be somebody’s pet. He has been neutered and had a health check with our vets✔️


Domino is a little shy, on arrival at foster he instantly hid himself away, but now he’s coming out of his shell his foster can confirm that he absolutely loves a belly rub, and he’s a complete sweetheart ❤️


**Please get in touch if you can offer Domino his forever home 🏡**
