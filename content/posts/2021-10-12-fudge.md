Fudge came into our care after he had been straying since his elderly owner died 💔

Luckily he came to us just in time (thanks to the lovely Jenny who contacted us after moving into the area 😘). He had an indolent ulcer on his lip and granulomas on his throat, most likely from a flea allergy as he was riddled with them 😫

The lumps on his throat would have continued to grow and within a month his throat would have been completely closed over, meaning he couldn't eat or breathe. We cant even imagine the painful ending poor Fudge would have had 💔

He had surgery to remove the granulomas and was treated to help his lip heal. He had lots of gentle grooming to rid him off all those fleas. And now he's doing the very best 🤩

He's approx 6 years old. Fudge is a friendly boy, he doesn't like being lifted but loves being petted, especially a wee ear rub 🥰

He's very chilled and just likes to curl up on the sofa or a high shelf to survey his kingdom. Unless he smells his food, then he moves faster than a Cheetah 😂

* He gets on grand with cats, and some calm dogs. But he would be very happy being the only animal in the house.
* Will need safe outdoor access
* Will need regular grooming for his long coat

**If you could offer Fudge his forever home please get in touch** !❤️
