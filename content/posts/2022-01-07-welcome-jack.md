> *Our wee Jack the JRT has been adopted 🤗*


Jack came to us a few months ago as a case of accidental neglect. His nails were curled and his skin was red raw. He was on meds but sadly for this wee man it was way out of control 😭


Jack went to an experienced JRT foster and fitted in like a glove with the furry residents. After a change of meds, which he’ll be on for life, and regular medicated baths this boy came on leaps and bounds and nobody needed to tell us he was already home 🏡


**He has even taken up the fostering himself with our wee old man Jacky. You couldn’t be in a better place Jack, wishing you all the luck that you’ll never need ❤️**
