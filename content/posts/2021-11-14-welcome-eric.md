* ### **Not yet ready for rehoming**

> *Our handsome man Eric arrived with us 3 months ago ❤️*


He was in horrendous condition, his skin was green with infection. He was covered in lumps and severely uncomfortable. It was heartbreaking 💔


Thankfully we bagged him an EBT home with lots of experience. They’ve their own EBT Mitch who was rescued in a similar state, so they were well versed in the recovery involved 😃


Eric is still getting treatment but he has come on so well, so well that we are expecting him to be signed off this week 🤞🏻 


We know Eric will always need help with his skin as it had gotten so bad but it can be managed quite easily with the treatment he has been receiving. Whoever his new family turn out to be will be made aware of this ✔️ 


Below are a few before and after pictures and we want to say a huge thank you to his foster family who have been extremely dedicated and thorough to his care and well being 👏🏻

Also a huge thank to everyone who has donated to Eric’s care, we simply couldn’t have done it without you 🙌🏻

He reminds us so much on our EBT Milah who we lost earlier this year. We believe she helped him find us ❤️

Eric has a long road ahead with extensive treatment so we are appealing for any help funding his medical work. Everything is greatly appreciated, check out the **[Donate](https://www.friendsofrescueni.com/donate/)** page to see all the ways you can help.
