> *Our long term patient and handsome Bull Terrier Eric has been adopted 💙*

Eric came to us with severe skin problems, he went to foster and we began the long journey to get it under control. Finally he was signed off from our vets with a plan for future management and it was time to find Eric his new home 🏡

But it didnt take much searching. Eric had been on such a journey with his dedicated foster family with constant vet visits, baths, adjusting food and medications that it was inevitable they would build quite a bond 🔗

Eric wouldnt be where he is without them, and importantly he wouldnt want to be anywhere else. They had fallen in love months ago so there was never any chance this boy was leaving, and we couldn’t be happier for all of them 🥰

**All the best beautiful boy, the pleasure was all ours** ❤️
