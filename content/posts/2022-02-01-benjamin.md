Benjamin came to us because his owners could no longer keep him and his brother. Both matured rabbits who began fighting so they were separated and neutered 🥜

Here is a little bit about this wee bun in the words of his foster ⬇️ 


Benjamin (Benny we call him lol) is getting on fab. He is very playful and energetic. He loves attention when he is ready for it. He will bite though if he feels restrained. So we have found that he loves to get out and have a whizz around the house or garden first and will then settle for a pet and cuddle and will even lay content on the sofa for pets. Pees and poos a lot, like any other rabbit but we’re still working on the potty training.


We will only rehome bunnies to adult only homes and indoors only ✔️ 


**Please gwt in touch if you can offer Benjamin his forever home 🏡**
