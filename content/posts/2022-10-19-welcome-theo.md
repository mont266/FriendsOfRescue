💙💙 WELCOME THEO 💙💙


This little yorkie man is Theo is 4 years old 😍


Theo was left into a vets by his owners to be euthanised 🤬

Swiftly moving on he has come to us, and in the vets was nervous enough that he needed meds for it but since being with us in foster let’s just say he is buck daft and there isn’t a cuddly toy safe around him 😆


**He is just doing the very best and we are so delighted that he's made it out of that vets alive to get a chance with a family who will adore him ❤️**
