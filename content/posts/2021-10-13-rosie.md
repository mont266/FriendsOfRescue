Our little Rosie has been ADOPTED 🎈

Honestly this adoption has made our year 🥰

Rosie’s rescue journey started a long time ago. She was very badly abused and when rescued  had to have a dead pups removed from her body. She was traumatised 😞

Rosie kept herself to herself and when people visited she didn’t interact making it hard for people to fall in love. But with a foster like Teresa (honestly this woman is a magician) she soon came round and she had a visit just a few weeks ago and that what that….signed sealed and delivered 🐶

Rosie can still be timid but those feelings don’t fade over night but OMG these pictures have made our hearts burst ❤️

She is happy and content enough to fall asleep on her mum and dad's knee. She snores like a pig haha. It’s genuinely one of those cases that it was so worth the wait 😍

Rosie, my sweet girl, you were a pleasure 🐶
