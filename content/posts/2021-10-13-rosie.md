Rosie was officially rescued a while ago when she was left into a vets in a state of complicated labour. Unfortunately Rosie had dead pups inside her and once these were removed and she was spayed... no one ever returned for her 💔

We don’t know what has happened Rosie but we know it probably isn’t good. She is a very timid girl, unsure of a lot and what will happen to her. Her foster has noticed how much she hates being outside so we assume she is worried about being left outside because that’s what she maybe had before 😞

Anyway, this is Rosie’s new start. New life, and she will learn the FOR way of how life is ment to be. She has one of the best foster mums and lots of doggy foster siblings to show her the ropes 😉

Rosie loves her walks, and adores other dogs and they really settle her so she will need canine buddies in her new home. She needs an understanding owner who will have patience and time for her nervousness. She just need someone to love her, she doesn’t look for much in return ❤️

**Please get in touch if you can offer Rosie her new start** 🐶
