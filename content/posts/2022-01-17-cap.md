Cap came to us from a feral litter who never had any human contact. He was shutdown and withdrawn for the first day or two, but after some TLC from his foster family, he wasn’t long coming round and became the most typical playful and annoying little pup who liked to chew laces 😆

He was a very popular boy who received a hell of alot of applications. However, we just had the one Cap. But we’re delighted that he has went to the best home. He’s settling in really well learning how to be a pet and the wee smartie pants is already picking up his commands and walking well on the lead. He is also a massive fan of a good belly rub and working his way through all his new toys 🎾


**All the best wee Cap, we are so happy you get to grow up in a loving home as part of a family like all dogs deserve 🏡**
