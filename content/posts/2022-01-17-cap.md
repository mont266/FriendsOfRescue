Cap was one of a litter of 3 who were more or less feral. He had a belly full of worms and having had little to no human interaction before he spent the first day or two in foster shut down with fear 😔

But fast forward a week and he is hard to recognise. Bursting out of his shell he has became the most typical, fun, interactive and loving wee pup 🐶

Cap will come with mandatory puppy classes included with his adoption. He can live with other dogs and dog savvy children. He is also young enough to learn to live with cats who are already used to dogs. As a collie pup he would like an active home that either has another dog to help with his stimulation or has humans around for most of the day ✔️
