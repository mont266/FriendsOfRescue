Harley is a little crackers but at only 10 months old, it’s kinda to be expected. She is learning her calm side in foster and is extremely affectionate….little sweetie 🤗
She’s can be a wee bit wary of men - she can get fearful and bark at them and cower. Not all the time, but sometimes she gets spooked by them, that again is something that can be continued to be worked on in her new home 🏠 
Harley can live with others dogs and kids 10+. She also need someone at home most of the day (no long working hours) and Lab experience would be beneficial ✔️ 
Please get in touch if you can offer Harley her forever home 🏡
