Our beautiful golden lady Harley has been adopted and has already created the most amazing bond with her new furry sibling Thor 🐶

Harley and Thor are inseparable. They sleep together, ‘neighbour hood watch' together, groom each other and generally just love in a bucket 😍

We are so happy for Harley 🐾

Good luck sweetie ❤️
