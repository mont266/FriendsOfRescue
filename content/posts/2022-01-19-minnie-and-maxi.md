> *These two brothers came to us together from the same household after their owner sadly passed away.*

We didnt believe they were bonded as when together they showed no interest in being in each other’s company whatsoever. So to help be rehomed we placed them in two new separate foster homes. However, they both displayed similar difficulties with settling so we have since placed them back together and they are two much happier chaps. So as a result they’ll be rehomed as a PAIR ✌🏼

At 7 years old they are both very calm and settled. They love their treats and curling up for a snooze when they’re not looking for a pet. Anybody who adopts them will be very lucky as they are two very sweet and affectionate boys who just want to be loved ❤️
