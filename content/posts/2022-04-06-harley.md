> Harley our handsome GSD has been adopted 💙

Harley came to us after being surrendered to the local pound as an unwanted pet. He really struggled in the kennel environment, he was so unsure, and scared and he was completely shut down 🥺

Thankfully he settled the best in foster and he was soon ready to find a new forever home. He is such a gentleman that just wants to love and be loved. So were so happy that this boy will never have to fret again ❤️

We often say in rescue that humans don’t pick the dog, but the dog picks you. And thats exactly what happened with Harley. He was always weary of new people, but he instantly took to his new mum and dad when they visited. So it’s no surprise that he has now settled like a dream into his new routine with them and is absolutely loving his walks and snuggles 🤗

Wishing you the happiest ever after Harley in your new home 🏡
