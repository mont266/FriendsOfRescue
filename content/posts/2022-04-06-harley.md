Harley was surrendered to a local dog pound as an unwanted pet.
Harley really, really, struggled in kennels. The environment completely shut him down. He wouldn’t eat, engage with anyone or anything. He was really failing 💔

The best thing to try and bring him out of this was a foster home, which is what we can provide. Harley arrived with us on Friday and oh my goodness the change in him has been unbelievable. Accepting pets, a dream in the house, loves his walks, eating well. A complete gentleman for his fosters, who are also first time fosters and they have been amazing with him ❤️


We simply can’t say enough good things about this fella. He is so settled, a complete gentleman and he will be an amazing addition to some lucky family. Harley could live with other dogs pending a successful meet and greet and dog savvy kids ✔️ 


Just look at the difference from his kennel picture to his foster picture 🥰

Kennels are so necessary in rescue, they save thousands of lives each year but some dogs just aren’t suited to them, so we are glad that although we don’t have the space to facilitate a lot of animals because we don’t have premises, we can help animals who need us like Harley 🐾
