Lady comes with her own very sad story. Lady’s owner passed away and she was left into the pound with a muzzle on. We don’t know how long it stayed on but she was so terrified. We don’t understand how anyone would feel that the pound is a place for a nervous, scared animal who just lost their family but anyway……

Lady is one of those wee dogs that although it’s takes a minute for her to warm to you, when she does, she is your friend for life. She is such an affectionate wee sweetheart who just wants to be friends. She was obviously only used to one way of life in her previous home but we have to say she has adapted so much better than we could ever have expected. She actually went to a newly recruited foster and they gelled straight away so she doesn’t necessarily need experience she just needs kindness and patience 🤗 

Lady would prefer an adult only home due to her nervousness and could possibly live with another calm older dog. Lady has recently had a dental and her vaccines and she is now ready for her new home 🏡
