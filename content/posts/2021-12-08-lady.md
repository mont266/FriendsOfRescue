> *Our little JRT called Lady has been adopted 🤗*



![](https://ucarecdn.com/8e7aa67a-5d17-44b7-b855-344e0df71b8c/)
Lady is 8 years old and came to us after being left into the pound with a muzzle on that had been on for three days 😭


She was rightly terrified and nervous but wasnt long in coming round in foster, and once out of her shell she showed us that she is very typical JRT ❤️‍🩹


So what better home could we find for her than one with two new JRT siblings, brother Leo and sister Lexie 🐶


**Best of luck Lady, it was our pleasure to help you on your way to your forever home 🏡**
