> *Our beautiful Pebbles at 11 years old is seeking her final retirement home where she can enjoy the life she should always have had ‚ù§Ô∏è*

Pebbles is a very special girl to us and when any animal is returned to rescue for whatever reason it is hard. But to be returned in a barely recognisable state is soul destroying. This won‚Äôt happen again.

Pebbles, same as before, will be on medication for the rest of her life to keep her allergies at bay and on drops to keep her eyes well hydrated and from being damaged any further. Pebbles can‚Äôt see anything out of her left eye, but can see shapes and shadows out of her right eye although this is very very limited. This gal is no dozer, she is full of fun, confidence, love and she knows if there is a plate of chicken in front of her whether she sees it or not.
Pebbles can live with other dog‚Äôs but we do want a peaceful home for her even though she is full of craic and loves her walks üòä
