> *Our wee Pebbles has finally been adopted and this time it’s for keeps 🥰*


Her lovely new family already have a little fluffer who has welcomed Pebbles in with open arms (well slightly open 😆) and Pebbles is just delighted 😃


We can’t even describe how amazing this little girl is, she was always was and she deserves this and more ❤️


**Pebbles will receive FOR support for the rest of her days just because she is so special and her new family we have no doubt will make her retirement a very special one 🥰**
