> *8 weeks ago these 4 tiny newborn kittens arrived into our care. We welcomed them in but we haven’t done many updates, purely because last year we lost so many and it was hard on us and more so on their foster mum lisa 🙌🏻*


Lisa took on the task as she does every year feeding hourly to keep these wee ones alive. And what a fantastic job she has done…..they are now vaccinated and ready for their new homes 🏡 




So formally introducing Talia (Pink), Toulouse (Blue), Rugrat (Green) and Ery (Red/Orange) and this is what they need ⬇️

• They must be rehomed in pairs, which they have chosen themselves as they developed- Toulouse & Talia, Rugrat & Ery
• These babies are in a multicat home with a very cat friendly dog
• They can live with cat savvy children - remember they are only babies themselves so will scratch and bite if they do not want lifted.
• They are babies and are still being fed 4 small meals a day, due to this no long working hours


**Please get in touch if you would like to offer any of our babies a 🏡**
