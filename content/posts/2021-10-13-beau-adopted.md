Our beautiful girl Beau has finally been adopted ![🎈](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tb/1/16/1f388.png)

Beau originally came into our care as a kitten, found in a shed with two mums and several more kittens, all needed treatment for ringworm and unfortunately some didnt make it ![💔](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/te7/1/16/1f494.png)

Beau was adopted and was very happy, unfortunately she had an accident which resulted in her tail needing amputated, this resulted in her becoming incontinent, and after a few months of trying she found herself back in our care to find a more suitable home ![🏠](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tf6/1/16/1f3e0.png)

Beau is such a sweet and special girl with very specific needs that we needed a very special home for her, someone who understands her and her needs and didnt mind the little accidents

We are absolutely delighted that Beau has landed herself in a first class home. Her new mum is so understanding and very experienced, infact Beau now has a brother who also has the same condition ![🙏🏻](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tfb/1/16/1f64f_1f3fb.png)

Best of luck blue Beau ![💙](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6c/1/16/1f499.png)
