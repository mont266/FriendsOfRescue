Our beautiful girl Beau has finally been adopted 🎈

Beau originally came into our care as a kitten, found in a shed with two mums and several more kittens, all needed treatment for ringworm and unfortunately some didnt make it 💔

Beau was adopted and was very happy, unfortunately she had an accident which resulted in her tail needing amputated, this resulted in her becoming incontinent, and after a few months of trying she found herself back in our care to find a more suitable home 🏠

Beau is such a sweet and special girl with very specific needs that we needed a very special home for her, someone who understands her and her needs and didnt mind the little accidents

We are absolutely delighted that Beau has landed herself in a first class home. Her new mum is so understanding and very experienced, infact Beau now has a brother who also has the same condition 🙏🏻

Best of luck blue Beau 💙
