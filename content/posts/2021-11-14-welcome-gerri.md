This handsome boy is Gerri and he is a 7 year old springer 🐶

Gerri has come to us after his owner sadly had to go into a home 😞

Gerri is as you can imagine a little unsure of his new life but he is doing so well. When he first arrived at our vets we noticed he had a lump on his abdomen we thought it was bladder related but once he emptied his bladder it was still there. A scan of his kidneys showed there was something and he is now on meds for a UTI, a sample or urine and bloods has been sent off to the lab 🧪

Gerri is settling into foster with his amazing spaniel loving family who have given him a lovely soft seat to recover 🥰

Welcome Gerri ❤️
