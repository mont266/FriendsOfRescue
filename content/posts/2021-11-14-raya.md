Raya is a wee sweetheart who adores human company. She likes doggy company too but doesn’t like excitable, energetic doggies so something calm and plaid would suit best. Raya could live with dog savvy kids also ✔️

Being a pup Raya will be adopted with puppy online classes that she must enroll in and attend to make sure she is a happy well rounded pooch 🐶

**Please get in touch if you can offer Raya a home 🏡**
