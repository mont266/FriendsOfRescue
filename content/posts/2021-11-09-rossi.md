> This big fella is Rossi, he is approx 3 years old and he is a Doberman mix 

![](https://ucarecdn.com/b7b138bb-b7d8-4e7d-8765-595b70cd1cbe/)

Rossi is a lovely sized boy, he is super affectionate and super strong. He has obviously never had any training in his life so he just needs a little guidance and encouragement but he is so eager to learn and please ☺️

Rossi gets along with other dogs, preferably smaller females with a successful meet and greet. There is no badness in him whatsoever but due to his boisterous personality kids over 12+ ✔️

**Please get in touch if you can offer Rossi a home** 🏠
