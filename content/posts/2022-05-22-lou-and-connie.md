Don’t let this hinder you or put you off because other than the clinical diagnosis and a few adaptions at home they are completely normal, happy healthy pups 🐶 


Both girls are extremely sociable and will need to be rehomed with canine company, an active family and no kids under 12. We would prefer deaf experience if possible as this would be so beneficial for their future ✔️ 


Like all our puppies under a year, these girls will be rehomed with compulsory online puppy classes included in your adoption fee. Puppies are in foster in Derry/Londonderry 🏡


**Please get in touch if you can offer one of these babies a home 
Welcome girls ❤️**
