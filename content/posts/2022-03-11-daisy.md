> *Our 2 year old mummy Daisy is now ready for her new home ❤️*

Daisy is a lovely wee teddy bear. She's so loving and so placid at home.  She could spend hours letting you pet her and god forbid you stop, she gives you big puppy dog eyes.  She stares into your soul with those gorgeous eyes 😍

When she arrived, she didn’t like going out of the house very much really, but now loves getting out walks and sitting out the back on a sunny day, now that she trusts she will get back into the house 🏠 


She has started playing with her toys and enjoys a wee carry on. And loves her treats 🥰

We have seen that some dogs she likes, some not so much. And others she lies on the ground until they pass so will def need an introduction to another family’s dog first to see how she gets on 🐶 


She seems to be grand when left but she's always had pups for company and even then it would only have been around 30minutes due to them being little so we aren’t sure what she would be like on her own ✔️ 


Daisy can be quite nervous at times. Like a bag falling off a unit and landing next to her had her ducking in fear. Or if your voice is too loud, things like that scare her a little. But she loves to greet you at the door by standing up on you. Daisy wouldn’t suit a crazy busy household, so bear that in mind before applying 🤗
