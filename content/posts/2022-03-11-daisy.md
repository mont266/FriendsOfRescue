> *Get the tissues ready 😥*


Our beautiful Daisy, had her babies with us, raised them and then finally we were seeking her new home. Her foster family loved her so much, the bond was so strong but they really wanted to continue fostering and this is a decision a lot of our fosters face.


Anyway, we couldn’t use any pictures from Daisy’s session snaps because she was looking so lovingly at her fosters that it almost seemed sad that she loved them so much but wasn’t staying. Anyway, with the urge to continue fostering, her appeal went up, but, her family couldn’t bear it…..and we were bloody delighted 😃 


The foster families daughter Caoimhe was particularly bonded with her, complete soul mates, but she also knew they could help so many animals by not adopting Daisy, although she didn’t want her to go. 


Second hand dogs make first class pets….they never considered one of Daisy’s beautiful babies that the world went mad for. It was ALWAYS her and that makes us love them as a family even more ❤️


**We couldn’t have asked for a happier ending for Daisy and Co 🐾**
