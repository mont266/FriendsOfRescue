Luna has been on our waiting list for quite some time. Unfortunately Luna's mum lost her mobility and was no longer able to care for Luna, the situation is truly heartbreaking but Luna has got the best foster mum to help get her through üòç

Luna loves attention and although she can still be timid with loud noises and newness that is something that will come with familiarity. 
Ideally Luna would join a cat free home with lots of company. Cat friendly kids would also be ok for Luna ‚úîÔ∏è 


**Welcome to the family Luna ‚ù§Ô∏è**
