> *Luna our tortie lady has been adopted 🤗*

Luna had spent a long time in rescue, like many adult cats, she was consistently overlooked because of her age. But when they do get a home, they’re always the best ones, and this is very much the case with Luna 🏡

Luna now lives with her new Mum and for a girl who previously would stress quite a bit she has settled the best. When shes not having a nosy out the floor to ceiling windows you can find her in her favourite spot on her mums knee and it just warms our heart 🥰

**Best of luck beautiful girl, youre in the right place to get all the love you deserve ❤️**
