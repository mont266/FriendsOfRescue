> *Tortie beauty Luna had been on our waiting list for quite some time.*

Luna was very much a loved pet but unfortunately her mum's health deteriorated, she lost her mobility and was no longer able to care for Luna 😞


Luna needed to be the only cat in the home so she had to wait a bit longer, but she’s found her hooman. Her dad said this about her, and we couldn’t agree more ⬇️


“Just because she’s a bit older doesn't mean she doesn't deserve some love too!” 🥰


She came around in her new home so quickly, she's been very playful and snuggly. Slotted right into her cosy new life as you can see ❤️


Good luck beautiful girl. It was a pleasure
