Both around 5 months old and 2 adorable kitty babies 🥰

They are used to a multi-cat environment, and although a little afraid, they are getting used to a dog so could live with cat friendly dogs.
Sooty is the braver of the 2 and Jess is adorable until you dare try to steal her food 😂

Both would happily also live with kids ✔️

**Please get in touch if you can offer these cuties a home 🏡**
