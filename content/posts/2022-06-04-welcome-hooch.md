> *This handsome smoosh of a British Bulldog is Sully and he is approx 3 years old 😍*

Sully was surrendered when his owner took unwell and unfortunately was no longer able to look after him, but thankfully he has been settling really well in foster 🏡

Sully is currently receiving treatment on a wee eye infection and is due to be neutered on monday ✔️
