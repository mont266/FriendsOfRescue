Our handsome toofy man has a brand new home üè†
This boy cheered up so many people with his beautiful smile and so many people wanted to invite him join their family but unfortunately we only had one Rupert üê∂

Rupert has settled in like a dream with his new family and we couldn‚Äôt be more pleased for him ‚ù§Ô∏è

Just remember guys we have 2 other black greys searching for their forever home and although they dont have fabulous teefies they have the same huge heart so please consider them üôèüèª

But anyway back to our influencer‚Ä¶.[\#famous](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/famous?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZXyZs--5fqgRi8v6-XrGAe3Dp4YCE_gNSgQEpWyUYZJb1v4L_RrDBQ7T4YDPf3MkScAUkaTog_xpHfkxW7MHJuNlgR9Pmi3jFzzZ1m6GD1HwXsc09rP9L936V0fIgDCkahVrFr5PhVy3PPTsmFPbqMO4UwR8TYVbyQkWntEJc1rng&__tn__=*NK-R)
