Milo came to us after his family moved abroad and had no choice but to leave him behind. He was well loved and cared for and so we’ll be sure that continues on for him ❤️



Milo loves to play, loves the beach, loves his walks, loves attention and loves belly rubs. He is a real wee character who will chat at you to be sure you know he's there and that it's time to play 😆



Milo is looking for quite an active home, where he can get his daily walks and play time. He is used to dog savvy children and can live with other dogs, or be the sole focus of attention ✔️



**Please get in touch if you can offer Milo his forever home 🏡**
