> Our wee Milo has been adopted 🤗

In true Yorkie style, wee Milo proved to be very popular and his appeal quickly filled our inbox. But there was just the one Milo to go round, so only one family have been lucky to enough to adopt him 🍀


Milo now lives with his new family, and they’ve said that he has fitted in so well it’s as if he’s been there forever. His favourite spot is with his hooman sister in her bedroom, and he likes to wake them all up in the mornings with some doggy kisses 😘


Milo was barely out the door from us and he was already away on his holidays. He was in his element as he absolutely loves the water and the beach, and he even made a wee doggy friend too 🐶


***All the best wee Milo, think it’s clear you’ve landed on all 4 paws ❤️***
