> This gorgeous nugget of tabby love is Lottie and she is looking for a new lap to sit on 🥰

Lottie arrived with FOR a good few months ago, with an extremely bad skin condition. She was in so much distress. Since being in foster she has come on leaps and bounds, her skin condition in now under control and managed with medication, giving her so much relief 🙏🏼


Lottie is an adorable and chatty wee lady. She loves cuddles and sitting on your lap.  She loves playing with her toys and doing “zoomies” around the house. Lottie also likes to interact with you, show her personality and remind you when it is feeding time 😆


Lottie will need to be an indoor only cat in order to avoid potential flare ups with her skin. She gets on really well with other cats, and could live with others or she would also be contented on her own. As a friendly gal she can live with cat savvy kids and she would be a wonderful addition to any family✔️
