> *This tabby beauty is Lottie. She came into our care after her finder who had several cats of their own struggled to get on top of her allergies ðŸ¤§*

Lottie had been self mutilating and scratching at her own skin until it bleeds. She is a very friendly girl and clearly used to human company so it is believed she was once a pet and then dumped because of her condition ðŸ’”


She has had a scratch test that has come back negative, so we believe it is likely to be  a flea allergy which is thankfully very manageable. She will be back to the vets soon for a review but in the meantime shes had a change of diet and medication and is responding very well. She has been great in foster and loves nothing more than sitting on their lap for some cuddles ðŸ¤—


**Welcome to the family Lottie ðŸ’ž**
