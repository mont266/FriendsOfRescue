> *This tabby beauty is Lottie. She came into our care after her finder who had several cats of their own struggled to get on top of her allergies 🤧*

This little tabby gal came into our care a few weeks ago with severe allergies that caused her to self mutilate and scratch her head until it bled 😭

Lottie has been undergoing treatment, she has changed her diet, is getting Hibiscrub washes every other day on her wee head and now thankfully some hair is starting to grow back. She does still have a tendency to scratch when her cone comes off but when the hair thickens a bit more this should settle down. So we are definitely heading in the right direction ✔️

Lotties's welcome post stated how friendly she was, suggesting she was once a loved pet which leads us to believe that she was abandoned because of her condition 🤬

She has been so let down and lived for too long in pain and discomfort. Yet somehow she holds no grudges and is so incredibly loving. Now she has settled in foster, we can see just how affectionate she is. She purrs during her wee washes just because she loves any kind of human interaction. In fact, she is just a wee purring machine, a total lovebug and her foster said if anybody meets her she is sure to win round their heart 😍

She still has a few weeks of treatment to go, but this girl deserves the world and we cannot wait to find Lottie her special person ❤️

**Welcome to the family Lottie ❤️**
