#### ❤️❤️ ADOPTION NEWS ❤️❤️

Our beautiful tabby cat Lottie has found her forever home 🥰

Lottie arrived with us several months ago in a bad way. She had an allergy and she had scratched herself into a bloody mess, where she should of had fur was covered in scabs or fresh wounds 🩹

After a lot of dedication and numerous vet visit with her foster, we finally found her balance and she was ready to rock. Like most adult cats Lottie was over looked for a while, that was until her new mum saw her appeal and it was love at first sight 😻

Lottie is now settling in a home where she is the only pet and is lapping up all the love and attention on offer 💗

**Good luck in your new home little lady, we know you'll do great 🏡**
