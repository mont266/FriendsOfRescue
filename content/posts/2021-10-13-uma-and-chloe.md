It gives us so much happiness to tell you all that at the beginning of this week Uma and Chloe were adopted ☺

These 2 gals found each other in foster and after an extremely rough journey for both of them they made it and their rescue story is complete ❤️


We couldn’t be happier for them, they have settled in so well and are adored already. We also wanted to say a huge thank you to their foster mum Hayley for sticking with these girls while they grew from kittens to cats and kept them safe and happy while we continued their search 🙏🏻


Sometimes the wait is so worth it ❤️
