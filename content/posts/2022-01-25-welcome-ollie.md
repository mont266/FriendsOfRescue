> *Our little Ollie has been adopted and we couldn’t have dreamed up a better home for him ❤️*

Little Ollie was born with disabilities to his back legs which affects his mobility which in turn means he has incontinence and this unfortunately isn’t something that can be fixed BUT he is so happy, content and lives life to the absolute fullest. He isn’t pathetic or looking sympathy, in fact all he wants is a carry on 😆

Ollie's new family are not only experienced in disabilities but also bullbreeds having cared for their late British bulldog who outlived his life expectancy because of their care 🥰


Ollie now has 2 bothers to play with, a set of fancy braces to keep his nappy on and his very own changing station for nappy changes 🐶

Ollie will be fitted for a set of wheels when he is fully grown, which we will happily cover and these will see him out in style on days he is maybe tired or wants to show off 😆


We can’t thank his new family enough and as always his amazing foster mum Kirsty, her care compassion and sheer dedication to her role is nothing short of admirable. We love you Kirsty ❤️


**Best of luck Ollie boy ❤️**
