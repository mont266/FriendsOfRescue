> *This wee baby is an 8 week old Frenchie 👶🏻* 

![](https://ucarecdn.com/d0609f76-26cf-437e-9bbb-3b72700deca1/)


Although he looks like a very normal wee pup, he has a disability causing him difficulty  walking and leaving him incontinent. This being said, he is a very happy wee pup who isn’t in pain but it isn’t ideal at all 😞


Thankfully his family knew he needed more than they could provide and they surrendered him over today with a donation of £500 for his care. So tomorrow we will start with some imaging of his body to see if we can pin point the issue to try and give him a better quality of life 🤞🏻


He is as cute as button with his whole life ahead of him so we are just hoping we can make it right for him 🙏🏻


**Welcome little tooty man Ollie ❤️**
