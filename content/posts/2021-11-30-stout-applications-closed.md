Our little Stout is home in time for Christmas, complete with a new furry brother Rocco and they both get on the very best ❤️

Stout is a the loveliest wee man, with the prettiest face to match and we couldn’t be happier for him and his kind family 😊


We would say good luck but he doesn’t need it 😉


Have a lovely Christmas folks 🎄
