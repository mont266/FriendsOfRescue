> This little man is Stout and he is a 5/6 month old springer spaniel 

![](https://ucarecdn.com/9ee7b819-33fc-4a2a-be69-44f5e07ed1f9/)

Stout is a pleasant wee man but can be a little shy sometimes. He soon comes round to his springer nature and has a good carry on 😄

Stout doesn’t like loud noises, he crouches and sometimes pees himself, so although he is fine with kids no rowdys lol ✔️ 



Welcome Stout
