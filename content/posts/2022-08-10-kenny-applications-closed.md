Kenny came to us alongside two other dogs, one of which was his mum, Hallie. He had only lived outside so far in his wee life, so since being in foster, indoors as a pet and part of the family he is absolutely loving it 🤗


Kenny loves his wee walks, and pets and play time. He clearly hadn't experienced much of a life before arriving with us, but he has settled great over the past week and his wee confidence has grew 🥰


Kenny is looking for a home where he can be loved for the rest of his days. He can live with doggy savvy children, as the only pet or with another dog pending a successful meet and greet ✔️


**Please get in touch if you can offer Kenny a forever home 🏡**
