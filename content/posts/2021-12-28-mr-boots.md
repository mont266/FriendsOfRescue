He was found several months ago by one of our adoptees and had clearly been through the mill. Unfortunately he tested positive for FIV but after a few vet trips and plenty of TLC from his amazing foster he was signed off as a completely healthy man ✔️


Sadly for Mr Boots, despite his good looks, chubby cheeks and amazing personality he didn’t generate much interest. That was until his new mum reached out to us, she has great experience with cats and could offer our Boots everything he needed and more. So we knew straight away she was his person 💞


He was a little unsure by the move, he was his usual friendly self but still chose to sit under the bed. Now fast forward a couple of days, hes playing like theres no tomorrow and the man is sprawled out on the sofa like he owns the place. He is most definitely home 🏡


**It was our pleasure Mr Boots, wishing you all the luck in the world ❤️**
