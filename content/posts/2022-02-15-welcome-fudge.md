> *Our wee Fudge has been adopted 🤗*

Fudge came to us in sad circumstances after his elderly dad was too sick to care for him. It was all he had known, so it heightened his anxiety but he went to foster and they set about healing his wee heart ❤️‍🩹


It didn’t take very long for Fudge to come round thanks to his amazing family, it was instant love all round. And even after losing almost all of his beautifully wonky teefs he could not be happier in his new forever home 🏡


Fudge foster family have been fostering for us since we started, their dream was to eventually adopt a golden puppy when they got a bigger house so when daisy had her babies, they booked one. Then fostered Fudge, and that changed everything. That just says everything about this family. This is why we have the best fosters and this is why we don’t mind losing fosters to our babies, because we know they get the best homes EVER ❤️


**All the best wee man, so happy you’ve found your happy ever after 💙**
