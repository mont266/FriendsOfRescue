Unfortunately Fudge's elderly dad became ro sick to care for him and this has made Fudge very sad, bless him, but he is in the best place to heal his heart ❤️ 


Poor Fudge sadly suffers with bad anxiety and spins around a bit when his anxiety intensifies but he does settle when he feels safe so we will work on that with him also 🥺


Fudge is great with dogs of all sizes and can be rehomed with dog savvy kids 8+ but mainly we will be looking for an understanding patient home that will let him live out his days in comfort and safety 🤗 


**Welcome to the family Fudge ❤️**
