Lucy is terrified, she has obviously been bred quite a few times and although we can’t say exactly what her history is we would take a wild stab that it isn’t pleasant judging but her overall demeanour 🥺


Her foster has said and we quote, ‘wee soul is absolutely terrified and she absolutely stinking’, ‘wee soul is shut down, so scared’, 'she wags her tail wen ur not near her, if u go near her, she just freezes. I don't think she has been inside too often, she’s obvs had pups recently as well’, ‘I have never smelt anything like it in my life’…..just not acceptable 😡

She's had a good few baths now and a little fresher. The poor girl hasn’t a clue what’s going on. Her foster is giving her time to settle and just taking baby steps to make her comfortable and she has been on a few short walks too…baby steps 🤗

Lucy is only 1 of the residents we have in atm and she needs a health-check, spayed, vaccinated and a dental. She is one apt this week, joining her we have Fudge for a dental, Winnie for her spay, Bella for her spay, chip and vaccines, Jacky for health check, neuter, vaccines and dental, Domino is being treated for cat flu….and 2 pups from a litter rehomed a few months ago are now ready for neutering 😖


We have managed to get our bill down to around £2000 (not sure of exact figure because 2 puppy vaccines and chips were done yesterday). We have gotten that down from £6000 which was just over 6 weeks ago but we need to get it down further and we are asking for your help 🙏🏻
