Scooby was surrendered to a pound and he joined us this week.

He is a lovely wee man, very cute and affectionate but my goodness does he need neutered….he is relentless 😂 his nickname is mr hump mchumperson 🥜 

Anyway, the boys will be firmly removed on Thursday ✔️ 

Scooby could live with other dogs, and dog savvy kids and will be available for rehoming next week 🐶

Welcome Scooby ❤️
