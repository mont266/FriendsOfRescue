Luna is a quirky wee character who loves head scratches and chin scratches but has to be on her terms. She loves to chat but has a very low squeak 🐭

She does zoomies a couple of times a day and spends some time in her bed to build up her energy. She loves her cheese chaser which can be seen in the video below 👇🏻

She does not like to be picked up and as previously stated everything is very much on her terms. So we are looking for someone who is patient with her, gives a calm home and one more calm cat may show her how to cat 🐱

She is happy being indoor only. She may benefit from a catio or secured garden but will run if let out side and will be hard to entice back in.

With regards to kids, they would have to be older, cat savvy kids who won't pet her apart from around her head which is the only place she likes to be petted ✔️

## **Please get in touch if you would consider giving Luna her forever home** !❤️
