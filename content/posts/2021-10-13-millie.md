> #### This little sweetie is Millie and she is a 14 week old collie baby 🐶

Millie is a wee sweetie. She adores company, keen to learn and even more eager to please 🤗

Millie like any puppy will need training, guidance and patience. Being a collie, she will need plenty of mental and physical exercise and that doesn’t mean run the legs off her….collies are kinda different kinda doggo, i.e they are smarter than us 😆

Millie would benefit from a home with other sociable dogs to guide her and can live with dog savvy kids. Millie will be enrolled into puppy classes post adoption which is included in her puppy pack so her new family can learn with her and ensure a happy well rounded doggy 🐶

**If you would like to offer Millie a home please get in touch.**
