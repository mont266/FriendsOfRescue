Toby has a new furry brother now called Cooper who sadly lost his brother Freddie just last month so he needed a new friend. Cooper is a blast from the past having been rehomed through two of our admins 6 years ago! Cooper was 1 part of 4, a feral clan of kelpies taken from a boarding scenario and honestly you wouldn’t recognise him. What a transformation. With support and love from his amazing family we have no doubt Toby will flourish just as much as Cooper 😍

Best of luck boys, and thanks to his wonderful family for choosing rescue again 🙏🏻
