> *Winnie our big bernadoodle babe has been adoped 🤗*

Winnie is a typical poodle cross in that she is daft as a brush, full of energy and love. So when she went to foster with former FOR gentleman Obie, we knew they would be chalk and cheese but we had a sneaky suspicion they would still hit it off, and that they did ❤️


Winnie has brought out big Obie's youthful side and the two of them have been amazing company for one another and spend alot of time pinching each others toys. Winnie's family have been working on her training which has come on great, but have accepted there is just a certain amount of mischief and looney that will always be there 😆


**All the best our beautiful big girl, were so happy for you in your forever home 🏡**
