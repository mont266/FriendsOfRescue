> *Our beautiful girl lucy has been adopted 🤗*

Lucy came to us in both a poor mental and physical state. Being fearful and anxious of any kind of interaction we assume she spent her previous life being bred on a puppy farm 🥺


Once in her foster home, Lucy slowly started to come out of her shell. She just needed time and patience and to be shown what kindness is. And that she has received in abundance. Her mum just loves the bones of her and the feeling was definitely mutual so she was home forever 🏡


Lucy is still a timid girl, that is something that will probably never leave her. But her confidence is growing and it makes us so happy to see videos of her tail going ninety mile an hour as shes taking her lead for a wee walk 😆


**All the best sweet lady, you deserve it all ❤️**
