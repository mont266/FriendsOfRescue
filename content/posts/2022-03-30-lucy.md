Lucy arrived with us in very poor shape, mentally and physically. She has improved a lot in foster and has since been signed off from our vets after getting spayed. So she is now ready for her new beginning ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Lucy will need a quieter home. A nice calm environment with no young kids. Lucy could live with another calm dog pending on a meet and greet. She is a very sweet girl, a gentle soul who deserves a beautiful life ‚ù§Ô∏è
