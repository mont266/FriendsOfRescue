Ivy is now ready to find her forever home. She is such an affectionate wee dote. Her foster says she gets excited to see people and loves playing, and running around. She loves her cuddles and climbing all over you to get them ![ü§ó](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tb7/1/16/1f917.png)

She is great on the lead and loves getting out for walkies. Ivy doesn't like to be alone very much, so she needs someone who is home a lot with no long working hours who can give her all the snuggles and pets she desires ![‚ù§Ô∏è](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6c/1/16/2764.png)

During her MOT it was discovered that Ivy has a low grade heart murmur, but she is asymptomatic so no further treatment or medication is needed right now but it something any potential owner will have to factor in for the future. Ivy can live with another dog pending a successful meet and greet, and can live with kids 8+ ![‚úîÔ∏è](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t51/1/16/2714.png)

**Please get in touch if you are able to offer Ivy her forever home** ![üè°](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t77/1/16/1f3e1.png)
