Our beautiful little squish Ivy has been rehomed and she is just adored beyond measure 😍

Ivy’s new family drove quite a distance to visit and it was love at first sight…..just how it should be 🐶

We are a absolutely delighted for her, she absolutely deserves it all and more 🙂

Good luck Ivy….look at that picture 🥰
