Ivy is just crackers in the best possible way! She is super friendly and loves doggy company aslong as they can keep up with her 😆

Ivy will need another playful dog in the home and is grand with dog savvy kids 12+ but she cannot live with cats  ❌

**Please get in touch if you can offer Ivy a home 🏠**
