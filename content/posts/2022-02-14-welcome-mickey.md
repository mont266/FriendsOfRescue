> *Mickey our little Collie cross pup has found his forever home 🏡*

Mickey, now called Milo, is learning how to dog from his new brother Thor and his new sister and former FOR gal Harley. He has settled so quick and it didn’t take him long to come out of his wee shell. He and Harley are just love in a bucket and have been joined at the hip since he moved in 💕

**All the best wee man, were so happy you found your new family and furry siblings ❤️**
