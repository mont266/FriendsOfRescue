Mickey is a typical inquisitive, crazy, affectionate puppy who will make a fantastic family pet for an outgoing family 🌳

He is learning his basic commands and adores the company of his foster brother. He has also lived with cats. Mickey ideally needs a home with another playful dog and no long working hours ✔️ 


All our puppies are rehomed with mandatory puppy classes to ensure well rounded, socialised, happy puppies 🐶 


**Welcome Mickey ❤️**
