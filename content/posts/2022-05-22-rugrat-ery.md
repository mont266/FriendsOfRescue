> *Our two little pairs of hand reared kittens have found their forever homes 🏡*

These babies came to us before their eyes had even opened, they didnt have the best of chances but thanks to the night feeds and dedication of foster mum lisa they are now all away to start their new forevers ❤️

Rugrat and Ery now live with their new mum and they settled the best. Ery is a bit more shy but thankfully has her brother with her to show her the ropes as he’s constantly lapping up the cuddles 🤗

Toulouse and Talia now live with their new family which includes two Rottweiler siblings who got a nice welcoming hiss 😆but they werent a bit phased and instantly set about exploring. They have since settled into a routine of being fed and read bedtime stories by their youngest human sibling 🥰
