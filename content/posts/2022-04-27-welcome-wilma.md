> *Our little golden oldie Wilma the JRT has been adopted 💗*

This wee woman found herself homeless at 14 years old which just broke our heart. But as soon as she was in foster she instantly settled and soaked up the home comforts and cuddles with her foster mum. It was clear early on she was going nowhere 🏡

Wilma, now called Suzi, lives with her new mum and fur sister Pepper. She has a new lease of life, her energy levels are improving and shes just been given a new lease of life. She is loving her walks, playing with her toys, watching the TV and so happy just being loved 🥰

Best of luck lovely lady, you’re never to old to find a happy ending ❤️
