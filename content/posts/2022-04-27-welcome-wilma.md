> *This little golden oldie is Wilma and she is 14 years young (her chip is 14 years old and last registered when she was sold 12 years ago) 🥺*

Wilma found herself as an unclaimed stray which at her age just breaks our heart that she found herself homeless. She has been settling into foster the best, shes a massive fan of cuddles, snoozes under the blanket and is just so grateful to be there and have home comforts 🏡


Wilma will need some bloods, a wee dental and an xray on her back legs that are slightly bowed. These will be done next week before we find a nice warm spot on someone’s sofa for her to retire on ✔️


**Welcome to the FOR family Wilma ❤️**
