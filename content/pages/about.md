  ## Our Story

    Friends Of Rescue was formed in 2017 with the aim of helping with the growing problem of unwanted and stray cats and dogs in the North West of Northern Ireland. 

    We are a foster based rescue, which means that our network of dedicated volunteers open their hearts and their homes to care for the animals in our care while we search for the perfect home for them. The animals who find themselves often come from less than ideal circumstances, so from the minute they arrive with us it’s vitally important to us to show them how life should be. 

    Our foster carers are the backbone of what we do and without them we wouldn’t be able to do what we do. To open your home to an animal, often with health issues, is a selfless act and one we are eternally grateful for.

    We primarily operate on social media to share the stories of the animals we have in our care, and to fundraise. At our core is a small team of volunteers who manage various aspects of the overall running of the organisation, and all the social media activities, which is vital to us getting our message out. 

    The following we have built online and the support we continue to receive from the public is what allows us to keep doing what we do. What started as a small endeavour has grown year on year, to the point where we are able to rehome hundreds of animals each year to new, loving homes. 

    We now have a foster network right across the country and are able to help animals from all corners of Northern Ireland.

dogAccordion:
  - description: Our minimum donation for our dogs is £120. This covers worm and
      flea treatment whilst in our care, neutering, vaccinations and
      microchipping.
    title: What is the minimum donation for dogs?
  - description: We like our dogs to be rehomed where they are indoors and part of
      the family. We do not rehome to outdoor homes. Likewise we do not rehome
      our dogs to be guard dogs or working dogs. Our dogs are pets only.
    title: How does vet care work?
  - description: All our adult dogs are neutered before rehoming unless they are a
      puppy or cannot be neutered due to health. If you are adopting a puppy you
      agree that they must be neutered by 6 months of age which will be followed
      up on by the rescue. Any existing pets in the home must be neutered before
      you would be considered.
    title: Are the dogs neutered?
  - description: We carry out homechecks for all of our animals. A secure fenced
      garden is essential for all of our dogs. The height of the fence will
      depend on the dogs size and abilities.
    title: How do you decide if a home is suitable?
  - description: Dogs should not be left alone for long periods of time so we will
      take into consideration the working hours of the household.
    title: I work long hours, am I suitable?
  - description: We will not rehome where you are moving house, considering moving
      house soon, if you haven't been in your current address for very long, if
      your planning a holiday or going away within 6months of adoption or if
      someone in the home is pregnant. All these circumstances can be very
      stressful for a new dog trying to find a routine in the new home.
    title: What factors are considered during the homecheck?
  - description: If you are in rented accommodation we will require written
      confirmation from your landlord that animals are allowed to be kept in the
      property. If housing executive we will need to see a copy of the terms and
      conditions that pets are allowed.
    title: I rent my house, can I still adopt?
  - description: While we will let prospective new owners know all we can about a
      dog we can't predict the future and behaviours may exhibit themselves in
      time. We try to be 100% transparent but we cannot be held responsible for
      any unwanted behaviours we weren't aware of at the time of rehoming.
    title: Can you tell me about certain dogs?
  - description: We are always here for help and advice but if you feel for any
      reason at any point down the line that you cannot keep or care for your
      adopted dog they must be returned to Friends of Rescue. They must not be
      passed on or sold. We will stand over our animals for their entire
      lifetime.
    title: What should I do if I can't continue to care for the dog(s)?

fosterAccordion:
  - description: When you choose to become a foster, you are choosing to help an
      animal in need, whether they are a stray, or have been surrendered. You
      are one of the first steps to their new life.
    title: What's involved in being a foster?
  - description: Fostering requires commitment and dedication and can last as little
      as a few days or slightly longer depending on the animal's needs.
    title: What's the committment to fostering?
  - description: Fosters must be willing to travel to our vets in Derry for any
      medical treatment the animals require. The foster must also be willing
      collect their foster animal from the vets after their initial health check
      upon entry.
    title: Are there any travel requirements?
  - description: Not all of our animals have had the best start to life, sometimes
      our animals are surrendered with a full medical history and other times
      none. Part of fostering is helping with assessments and reporting the
      findings back to ourselves. You will also be required to speak with
      prospective adopters about the animal in your care and if necessary be
      willing to travel to a neutral meeting place.
    title: Is there anything I should know about a specific animal?
  - description: We provide everything the animal needs, beds, bowls, food and
      medication, you provide the animal with a safe indoor space and most
      importantly show them what it means to be part of a family.
    title: Do I need to buy my own supplies?
  - description: Please email us to request an application form and our foster policy.
    title: How do I apply?
catAccordion:
  - description: Our minimum donation for our cats is £45. This covers a worm and
      flea treatment whilst in our care, neutering, vaccinations and
      microchipping.
    title: What is the minimum donation for cats?
  - description: All our cats and kittens old enough to be neutered will be done by
      the time of adoption. If adopting kittens you agree to have them neutered
      by a date agreed between the rescue and the adoptee. Any existing pets in
      home must be neutered before you would be considered.
    title: Are cats neutered?
  - description: We will not rehome where you are moving house, considering moving
      house soon, if you haven't been in your current address for very long, if
      your planning a holiday or going away within 6months of adoption or if
      someone in the home is pregnant. All these circumstances can be very
      stressful for a new cat or kitten.
    title: What factors are considered during the homecheck?
  - description: If you are in rented accommodation we will require written
      confirmation from your landlord that animals are allowed to be kept in the
      property. If housing executive we will need to see a copy of the terms and
      conditions that pets are allowed.
    title: I rent my house, can I still adopt?
  - description: Kittens cannot be left for long periods of time when they are young
      as they are very social. Your time away from the home can be increased the
      older the kitten becomes. Cats and kittens love company and we would
      always suggest adopting in pairs.
    title: I work long hours, am I suitable?
  - description: Kittens must be kept indoors until they are neutered. Depending on
      the cat, adults will need to be kept indoors for a minimum period of 6
      weeks.
    title: Can I let cats outside immediately?
  - description: We will not rehome our cats as completely outdoor cats unless they
      are ferals. We will not rehome our cats for pest control.
    title: Are there any reasons a cat won't be rehomed?
  - description: We are always here for help and advice but if you feel for any
      reason at any point down the line that you cannot keep or care for your
      adopted dog they must be returned to Friends of Rescue. They must not be
      passed on or sold. We will stand over our animals for their entire
      lifetime.
