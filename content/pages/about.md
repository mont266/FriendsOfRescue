  ## About the Charity
    Friends Of Rescue was formed in 2017 with the aim of helping with the growing problem of unwanted and stray cats and dogs in the North West of Northern Ireland. 

    We are a foster based rescue, which means that our network of dedicated volunteers open their hearts and their homes to care for the animals in our care while we search for the perfect home for them. The animals who find themselves often come from less than ideal circumstances, so from the minute they arrive with us it’s vitally important to us to show them how life should be. 

    Our foster carers are the backbone of what we do and without them we wouldn’t be able to do what we do. To open your home to a cat or a dog, often with health issues, is a selfless act and one we are eternally grateful for.

    We primarily operate on social media to share the stories of the animals we have in our care, and to fundraise. At our core is a small team of administrators who manage various aspects of the overall running of the organisation, and all the social media activities which is so vital to us getting our message out. 

    The following we have built online and support we continue to receive from the public is what allows us to keep doing what we do, and what started as a small endeavour has grown year on year to the point where we are able to rehome hundreds of animals each year to new, loving homes. 

    We now have a foster network right across the country and are able to help animals from all corners of Northern Ireland.

  # Dog Adoption Policy
dogAccordion:
  - description: Our minimum donation for our dogs is £150. This covers worm and flea treatment whilst in our care, neutering/spayed, vaccinations and microchipping. Our minimum donation for our puppies is £180, which includes compulsory online puppy classes.
    title: What is the minimum donation for dogs?
  - description: All our adult dogs are neutered/spayed before rehoming unless they cannot be neutered/spayed due to health. If you are adopting a puppy you agree that they must be neutered/spayed by 6 months of age which will be followed up on by the rescue. Any existing pets in the home must be neutered before you would be considered (proof is required, or permission to contact your vet to confirm).
    title: Are the dogs neutered?
  - description: We use the information given to us in an adoption application to find the best match for each cat’s individual needs. We carry out home checks for all of our animals. A secure fenced garden is ideal for all of our dogs. The height of the fence will depend on the dog's size and abilities. We like our dogs to be rehomed where they are indoors and part of the family. We do not rehome to outdoor homes. Likewise we do not rehome our dogs to be guard dogs or working dogs. Our dogs are pets only.
    title: How do you decide if a home is suitable?
  - description: Typically we will not rehome where you are moving house, considering moving house soon, if you haven't been in your current address for very long, if you're planning a holiday or going away within 6months of adoption or if someone in the home is pregnant. All these circumstances can be very stressful for a new dog or puppy trying to find a routine in the new home. 
    title: What factors are considered during the homecheck?
  - description: Yes, we have rehomed to many homes where there have been young children. This is completely dependent on the dog’s needs. If a dog is happy and safe to be around children then this would be stated in the rehoming appeal requirements.
    title: Can I adopt a dog if I have young children?
  - description: Dogs should not be left alone for long periods of time so we will take into consideration the working hours of the household along with the individual requirements of each dog. 
    title: I work long hours, Am I suitable?
  - description: If you are in rented accommodation we will require written confirmation from your landlord that animals are allowed to be kept in the property. If your home is housing executive, we will need to see a copy of the terms and conditions that pets are allowed. 
    title: I rent my house, Can I still adopt?
  - description: Sometimes we have the dog’s history and sometimes they are surrendered with very minimal information. We will let prospective new owners know all we can about a dog, however we can't predict any new future behaviours which may exhibit themselves in time. We will always be 100% transparent but we cannot be held responsible for any unwanted behaviours we weren't aware of at the time of rehoming.

  # Cat Adoption Policy
catAccordion:
  - description: Our minimum adoption donation for our cats is £50. This covers worm and flea treatment whilst in our care, neutering/spaying, vaccinations and microchipping.
    title: What is the minimum donation for cats?
  - description: If a cat/ kitten is old enough to be neutered/spayed, this will be done prior to adoption. If adopting young kittens, you must agree to have them neutered by a date agreed with Friends of Rescue.
    title: Are cats neutered?
  - description: We use the information given to us in an adoption application to find the best match for each cat’s individual needs. We carry out home checks for all of our animals. We will not rehome our cats as completely outdoor cats unless they are ferals. We will not rehome our cats for pest control.
    title: How do you decide if a home is suitable?
  - description: Typically we will not rehome when you are moving house; considering moving house soon; if you haven't been in your current address for very long; if you are planning a holiday or going away soon after adoption; or if someone in the home is pregnant. All these circumstances can be very stressful for a new cat or kitten. 
    title: What factors are considered during the homecheck?
  - description: If you are in rented accommodation we will require written confirmation from your landlord that animals are allowed to be kept in the property. If your home is housing executive, we will need to see a copy of the terms and conditions that pets are allowed. 
    title: I rent my house, Can I still adopt?
  - description: Kittens cannot be left for long periods of time when they are young as they are very sociable. Kittens love company and usually we would suggest adopting in pairs for this reason. Your time away from the home can be increased the older the kitten becomes. For older cats, it would depend on their individual needs.
    title: I work long hours, Am I suitable?
  - description: Cats need time to adjust and settle in a new home. They could get into serious danger trying to return to their previous home. To prevent this, cats need to be kept indoors for a minimum period of 6 weeks. Kittens must also be kept indoors until they are neutered/spayed. Ensure your cat's behaviour has settled before letting them outside.
    title: Can I let cats outside immediately?

  # Foster Policy
fosterAccordion:
  - description: When you choose to become a foster, you are committing to help an animal in need, whether they are a stray, or have been surrendered. You are one of the first steps to their new life, so the most important thing is showering them with love.
    title: What's involved in being a foster?
  - description: Fostering requires commitment and dedication and can last as little as a few days or slightly longer depending on the animal's needs. 
    title: What's the commitment to fostering?
  - description: Fosters must be willing to travel to our vets in Derry for any medical treatment the animals require. The foster must also be willing to collect their foster animal from the vets after their initial health check upon entry. 
    title: Are there any travel requirements?
  - description: Not all of our animals have had the best start to life, sometimes our animals are surrendered with a full medical history and other times none. Part of fostering is helping with assessments and reporting your observations back to us. You will also be required to speak with prospective adopters about the animal in your care and if necessary be willing to travel to a neutral meeting place. 
    title: Is there anything I should know about a specific animal?
  - description: We provide everything the animal needs, beds, bowls, food and medication, you provide the animal with a safe indoor space and most importantly show them what it means to be part of a family. 
    title: Do I need to buy my own supplies?
  - description: If you have any other questions or wish to apply, please get in touch to request a Fostering Application, via the website enquiry form, email or Facebook Messenger.
